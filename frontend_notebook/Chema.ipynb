On Saturday, June 25, 140 of the bank&rsquo;s volunteers planted almost 500 trees &mdash; a part of the bank&rsquo;s commitment to grow 50,000 fruit bearing trees in Raigad and Igatpuri, Maharashtra. This is in addition to 40,000 trees that were planted as part of the bank&rsquo;s 40th India anniversary celebrations in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In recent years factors such as unpredictable weather conditions, deforestation and unsustainable farming practices have severely affected crop production. This has created a financial burden on farmers and compelled them to migrate in search of work. Through its CSR In the Community programme, the bank has partnered with Swades Foundation to support people in rural parts of the state by providing sustainable means of livelihood.</p>\\n<p>These trees, which include the likes of mango, coconut, sapodilla, cashew and guava, will augment the income of farmers in these regions. Planted in areas where farming is not possible, each tree is expected to provide farmers with an additional income of 1,500 to 2,000 rupees (~18 to ~24 euros) per tree in the next four years.</p>\\n<p>Ritesh Singh, one of the bank&rsquo;s volunteers for the tree planting said, &ldquo;It was truly wonderful being part of the tree plantation project. I am happy that we were able to plant almost 500 trees which will not only benefit the farmers here, but also the environment. We are glad and grateful to have contributed our bit, though small, to this massive cause.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>Expressing their gratitude for Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s support, Tushar Sud, Director &ndash; Partnerships, Swades Foundation said, &ldquo;It was heart-warming to see the enthusiastic volunteers put in the effort to make our plantation drive a success. It is because of your willingness and support that we are able to make a lasting difference to rural communities in Maharashtra.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank and Swades Foundation have been working towards rural transformation since 2016.&nbsp; Through the partnership&rsquo;s flagship programme, more than 11,500 households now have access to safe drinking water and over 1,000 rural households have adequate water for irrigation.</p>', 'url': '/content.1b4cbe4f-8da3-42b2-aeae-e4fbd4fc39e8', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220708-deutsche-bank-partners-with-swades-foundation-to-plant-90-000-fruit-bearing-trees-in-rural-maharashtra-india', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': '04e38c1d-37b2-42dc-8454-b473d03b15c8'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-07-06 16:04:09.357', 'publishDate': '2022-07-05 16:15:00.0', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank publishes Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2021', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'ca65c6b1-2b70-4cdc-896b-ccdb02a96af6', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank publishes Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2021', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4454', 'identifier': '2f39452b-24fa-43df-b051-40806ff9d20d', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/what-we-do/responsibility/sustainability/responsible-banking/human-rights?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">db.com page Human Rights</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/files/documents/csr/sustainability/DB_Modern Slavery Report_2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2021</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220705-deutsche-bank-publishes-modern-slavery-and-human-trafficking-statement-2021', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220705-deutsche-bank-publishes-modern-slavery-and-human-trafficking-statement-2021', 'richText': '<p>Deutsche Bank has published its <a href=\"https://www.db.com/files/documents/csr/sustainability/DB_Modern Slavery Report_2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2021</a>. This is an annual statement published mid-way through the year since 2017. It describes how the bank approaches human rights issues and how it is helping to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. For example, 2021 saw the company publish a revised code of conduct for suppliers and introduce EcoVadis Sustainability Ratings, which are used to assess suppliers&rsquo; compliance with a set of 21 sustainability measures. The bank also made efforts to increase awareness of the topic of human rights amongst its employees by holding training sessions on sustainable finance and corporate social and environmental responsibility.&nbsp; In addition, the bank organised a staff training event last year in partnership with Stop The Traffik, an NGO that works to combat modern slavery and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>More information on what the bank is doing to ensure respect for human rights can be found <a href=\"https://www.db.com/what-we-do/responsibility/sustainability/responsible-banking/human-rights?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank is committed to ensuring that human rights are respected. It continuously works to improve its internal guidelines and initiatives on human rights issues.</p>\\n<p>In 2020, the bank set up the group-wide Human Rights Working Group, which brings together management staff from a range of departments including Anti-Financial Crime (AFC), Procurement, Non-Financial Risk Management, Legal, HR, Communications and Social Responsibility. They track developments in human rights around the world, identify significant risks for the bank in this area and coordinate human rights activities across the group.</p>\\n<p>The profits from modern slavery and human trafficking are often fed into the global financial system. This allows criminals to launder the illegal funds, making them appear legitimate. To tackle this, the Anti-Financial Crime department set up an additional human rights working group in 2021 focussed on financial crime.</p>', 'url': '/content.cc2dab66-cf87-4399-aaf1-68d980479bfa', 'titleImage': 'TITLE_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND', 'modUserName': 'Claudia Wojan', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220705-deutsche-bank-publishes-modern-slavery-and-human-trafficking-statement-2021', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': False, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.4454', 'location': 'Frankfurt am Main'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-07-04 11:07:47.527', 'publishDate': '2022-07-01 19:30:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'sebastian.jost@db.com', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank Mourns the Passing of Kimberly Hammonds, A Former Member of the Management Board', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'ca7a731b-f395-4122-a065-f045f4082765', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank Mourns the Passing of Kimberly Hammonds, A Former Member of the Management Board', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.2909', 'identifier': '02efbb71-25a5-484e-8ce4-d00f001c42ae', 'urlTitle': '20220701-deutsche-bank-mourns-the-passing-kimberly-hammonds-a-former-member-of-the-management-board', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220701-deutsche-bank-mourns-the-passing-kimberly-hammonds-a-former-member-of-the-management-board', 'richText': '<p>Kimberly Hammonds\\' untimely passing fills us with deep sadness.

We are also deeply involved in building the green leasing system, proactively participating in the leading green finance standards systems globally, and exploring opportunities in sustainable development and ESG. Together with partners such as Deutsche Bank, Tiancheng Leasing will continue promoting the sustainable development of the clean energy industry by closely integrating industry expertise with innovative financial products. &rdquo;</p>\\n<p>International investors have been sensitive to differences in standards and approaches to green financing in global markets, and have sought more clarity and a unified approach. In order to address this need, the Common Ground Taxonomy- (CGT) was published by the International Sustainable Finance Platform (IPSF) Taxonomy Working Group Co-chaired by the EU and China in November 2021. The CGT is a key milestone in providing clarity about the commonality and differences between the EU&rsquo;s and China&rsquo;s green taxonomies. It is expected to play a pivotal role in increasing comparability of sustainable finance taxonomies and definitions of green and/or sustainable activities globally.</p>\\n<p><em>For further information, please contact:</em></p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank AG</p>\\n<p>Media Relations</p>\\n<p>Flora Tian</p>\\n<p>Tel. +86 10 5969 8617<br /> Email&nbsp;flora.tian@db.com</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'url': '/content.b8697648-6019-41a1-8916-3334fd82cb9e', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220615-deutsche-bank-helps-huaneng-leasing-with-sustainable-trade-finance-aligned-to-china-s-common-ground-taxonomy', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': 'e9282c3b-3c38-4a07-8308-a0002962ada9', 'secondReadingBox': '<p>About Deutsche Bank</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank provides retail and private banking, corporate and transaction banking, lending, asset and wealth management products and services as well as focused investment banking to private individuals, small and medium-sized companies, corporations, governments and institutional investors.

The crypto asset ecosystem shows how some aspects of banking and finance can be reinvented with modern paradigms, says Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Boon-Hiong Chan. Watch our latest &ldquo;150 seconds on APAC&rdquo; video to learn more.</p>\\n<p><em>You can also read the full transcript of the video here:&nbsp;</em></p>\\n<p>Digital assets are driving changes in ways that the French central bank governor has termed as the Triple Revolution &ndash; with forms of financial or settlement assets, new roles, and new infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What types of digital assets are shaping APAC?</em></p>\\n<p>A: The first ecosystem is the Crypto asset one exemplified by bitcoin and ethereum. Within this ecosystem is Decentralised Finance or DeFi represented by DAI, Uniswap and Curve. Altogether they have introduced innovative possibilities that have been leveraged in our industry.</p>\\n<p>The second digital asset ecosystem is the tokenised financial one &ndash; exemplified by digital bonds, or digital fractionalised bonds.</p>\\n<p>The third ecosystem is a potentially huge one represented by central bank digital currencies or the CBDC space.</p>\\n<p>Altogether these three digital ecosystems are the new settlements or financial assets in the triple revolution.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: How are crypto assets driving change in Asia Pacific</em></p>\\n<p>A: Around 2015, bitcoin showed that a cross border value transfer can occur within 10 minutes roughly, which showed the way for&nbsp;today&rsquo;s faster and cheaper cross-border bank and fintech-facilitated transfers.</p>\\n<p>Second example, block chain is allowing digital true copy. Think about it &ndash; in the digital&nbsp;land when you do copy and paste, it&rsquo;s difficult to identify which is the original and which is the copy. With blockchain, it is now possible. And is now being used for example to represent &ldquo;original&rdquo; title transfer documents like bill of lading or title transfer documents.</p>\\n<p>ICO or Initial Coin Offering with its possibility for a direct peer-to-peer distribution capability is another example. In APAC, Thailand has used this model for financial inclusion initiatives, when its ministry of finance issued and distributed digital saving bonds directly into retail investors.</p>\\n<p>In the DeFi space, DeFi is showing how low touch neo banking activities like borrowing, lending, and even micro precision like compounding interests at each block interval is possible. In this space, it has also pioneered self-hosted custody of digital assets, so you keep your own assets safe.</p>\\n<p>The crypto asset ecosystem shows how some banking and finance aspects can be reinvented with modern paradigms.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">The key here, for positive things to continue, is to innovate responsibly from the regulators&rsquo; lenses.</blockquote>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'url': '/content.cec962f1-fdca-42b1-9bce-ae8dfafa13e0', 'newsTags': 'Newsroom', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220608-how-are-crypto-assets-driving-the-future-of-finance-in-asia-pacific', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': 'e8868658-7827-49d3-9d16-407ae1908729'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-06-07 08:06:17.47', 'publishDate': '2022-06-07 09:00:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'senthuran.shanmugasivam@db.com', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank selects Berlin as its latest Technology Centre location', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '467b1f58-c04f-479a-bf01-e9f6a455cc8f', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank selects Berlin as its latest Technology Centre location', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3059', 'identifier': '93930f99-f4b1-4971-8879-82bf08fd810a', 'urlTitle': '20220607-deutsche-bank-selects-berlin-as-its-latest-technology-centre-location', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220607-deutsche-bank-selects-berlin-as-its-latest-technology-centre-location', 'richText': '<p>Deutsche Bank has announced that it will establish its next Technology Centre in Berlin, Germany.

How is the market opening up to investors? Watch our &ldquo;150 seconds on APAC&rdquo; video with Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Samuel Fischer to learn more.</p>\\n<p><em>You can also read the full transcript of the video here:&nbsp;</em></p>\\n<p><em>Q: How are Panda Bonds opening up to European investors?</em></p>\\n<p>A: Panda Bonds allow European issuers to access the huge Chinese capital market. What we find issuers most concerned about usually is the timeline it takes to register a domestic program in China. But Chinese authorities have made huge strides in simplifying market access. In 2020 NAFMII has introduced a simplified bond registration and issuance mechanism and we have seen several Panda Bond issuers come to the market under new shelf programmes.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: Which client sectors want to tap into Panda Bonds?</em></p>\\n<p>A: Sector wise, we may see more diversified industrials in addition to auto makers which have played a leading role and are expected to continue doing so in the future. ESG will be a major driver as the EU-China common ground taxonomy which was announced last year will allow European issuers to access the onshore market based on their global frameworks. So, this should definitely be an important new and additional driver for market growth.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What opportunities lie ahead for investors?</em></p>\\n<p>A: We are very optimistic about the Panda Bond market and we expect more European issuers to come to this market in public issuance format to make use of the attractive funding levels, the depth of the market and importantly to match their huge assets inside China. Panda Bonds don\\'t just happen. They involve a consistent effort with our clients to educate them and help them on understanding the requirements for coming into the market. But once clients have set up their programs and set up their documentation, the benefits can be huge in terms of the size of the market and in terms of arbitrage opportunities, which are open to those who have done the work and are ready to tap the market.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://country.db.com/asia-pacific/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Find out more about Deutsche Bank in Asia Pacific\">Find out more about Deutsche Bank in Asia Pacific</a>.</p>', 'url': '/content.42ea279e-a36d-4a75-b3b6-5868f1616117', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220525-how-is-the-panda-bond-market-opening-up-to-global-investors', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': '4a690396-4479-4fc1-b6b0-bf30dd7ffc04'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-05-24 11:05:56.577', 'publishDate': '2022-05-24 12:00:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'jenny.voigtlaender@db.com', 'title': 'China\\'s \"Whatever it takes\" moment?', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'ddb9da16-ec6e-4998-8509-4367e3adce82', 'teaserText': 'Q&A with Yi Xiong, Chief Economist, China', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'China\\'s \"Whatever it takes\" moment?', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3038', 'identifier': '9a6f0cfd-b832-43f0-a916-0e60b87b039d', 'urlTitle': '20220524-china-s-whatever-it-takes-moment', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220524-china-s-whatever-it-takes-moment', 'richText': '<p>In the latest in our &lsquo;Q&amp;A with&rsquo; series, Yi Xiong, Chief Economist, China reviews the country&rsquo;s recent economic performance and shares his insights on what policymakers need to do to stabilise the economy.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: How much impact have recent Covid outbreaks had on China&rsquo;s economy?</em></p>\\n<p>A: With China only publishing quarterly GDP figures, we estimate that output growth, based on monthly production, retail and trade data, slowed from 6 percent in January and February to 3 percent in March, and further to -2 percent in April. Activity has begun to improve lately but only at a modest pace. We forecast GDP growth will drop to 0.5 percent in Q2 from 4.8 percent in Q1.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What are the main risks to the economy?</em></p>\\n<p>A: The three major challenges under today&rsquo;s low growth environment are (1) rising unemployment rates, especially among the youth; (2) a prolonged property downturn that raises financial stability concerns; and (3) continued RMB depreciation and capital outflows.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What do you think policymakers will do?</em></p>\\n<p>A: We think Chinese policymakers will do whatever it takes to stabilise the economy. They are likely to boost vaccine protection and roll out regular testing in bigger cities to prevent future lockdowns. The fiscal stimulus package could be increased to a size comparable to what was delivered in 2020. The PBOC is likely to cut mortgage rates further and encourage bank property lending to support the housing market.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank Research clients can read the full report <a href=\"https://research.db.com/Research/namedFileProxy/2795-88ebf4c6_7e73_44dd_b540_8c1ffe2caa69_604/88ebf4c6_7e73_44dd_b540_8c1ffe2caa69_604.pdf?filetoken=YYY122_TDLwOf7cRa%2F%2F7rm4IAXMf%2FwA3AXn66tiqWHLCn7YJDAysP6Zw78wvMawM%2BSHeV3qbk8G%2FHEXm8CHtIds80IsX%2FtaSuZw%2BlqDPncZhQTZaEc%3D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\\n<p>Read more Q&amp;A with interviews <a href=\"https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RPS_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000522471.alias?&amp;rwnode=RPS_EN-PROD$PROD0000000000522471&amp;invalid-verification=3hBLNka10EO94dJRYwBFfJxgaGMtP7i8XvTgwStaYYNpuokCMrrzTUeYrgFPBWnhXiT6O/qnaWdyV380KLiX1xRJSSqNQTM3BL8qhmn1EpYj11wPIy0HhSNkUo9jwNu4nt%20gH5Lm6iC/M0TG25oA/dr5ewOCyppds3fFVFtOBh9isSUeNsq7vqEHQf1CNOtvUdPKyWrhIN6BQM2NozOJjKt3tMeSn4cWTGnkOpdi7NlUjtrJ7XASttRbmSyxkch12hOc5DgcBdXWpxAylnHcl%20gq2CWoxEOTIkhEq6yV6GI=&amp;reaction=Zz7cpMY84jGfooF/C5KbBCmbIp4tfGzYxBDAyS8VEvQ=\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/Yi-Xiong-dbNetwork-600X400.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"Yi_Xiong_dbNetwork_600X400\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>', 'url': '/content.c1e9fc59-0121-4a8a-b0ab-f7510f9a67a0', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Jenny Voigtlaender', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220524-china-s-whatever-it-takes-moment', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.3038', 'imageSmall': 'c3e61d60-aaf0-4be5-926b-a5c576d1c95f'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-05-20 08:52:41.727', 'publishDate': '2022-05-20 10:00:00.0', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank joins RE100 commitment to renewable electricity', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'f1242407-8b99-40d1-ba36-a8c2fb4af155', 'archived': False, 'subHeadline': 'The bank sets a target of sourcing 100% renewable electricity to cover its own operations by 2025', 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank joins RE100 commitment to renewable electricity', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4958', 'identifier': 'cc2f3e9e-d499-43f7-a7cc-c4f83ca5c357', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/strategy\" title=\"Deutsche Bank Strategy\">Deutsche Bank Strategy</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://db.com/sustainability\" title=\"Deutsche Bank Sustainabilty\">Deutsche Bank Sustainabilty</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220518-deutsche-bank-joins-re100-commitment-to-renewable-electricity', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220518-deutsche-bank-joins-re100-commitment-to-renewable-electricity', 'richText': '<p>Deutsche Bank has become a member of RE100, a global initiative led by the Climate Group, that brings together influential businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity across their operations.</p>\\n<p>The bank has set a target to source 100% renewable electricity to cover its own operations by 2025.

KGaA (Henkel) supply chain finance program to the ESG ratings of Henkel's suppliers. Deutsche Bank is the first bank in Europe to convert an existing supply chain finance program for its client. Through this program, Henkel creates incentives for its suppliers to be more sustainable.</p>\\n<p>A Henkel supplier can receive payment immediately after an invoice has been approved by Henkel. The financing costs for the suppliers are based on Henkel's creditworthiness, which means that the suppliers can usually lower their typical financing costs. By improving their ESG rating, suppliers can further reduce financing costs in the supply chain. The prerequisite for this is that they have a corresponding ESG rating.</p>\\n<p>Initially, Henkel suppliers in Europe which are integrated into the existing supply chain finance program with Deutsche Bank can benefit from the new structure. Henkel's supply chain finance program for Europe is among the largest in the industry. In a further step, the program will be expanded to include suppliers outside of Europe.</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;The idea of \\u200b\\u200bincorporating sustainability criteria into a supply chain finance program has been around for a long time. For the first time, we can now put this into practice with Henkel,&rdquo; said Michael Dietz, Head of Trade Finance Flow, Deutsche Bank. &ldquo;Reducing CO2 emissions in the supply chain has a major impact on a company's carbon footprint, because that's where the majority of emissions occur in most industries,&rdquo; Dietz said. In addition to the environmental component (&ldquo;E&rdquo;), the program also takes into account social aspects (&ldquo;S&rdquo;) and good corporate governance (&ldquo;G&rdquo;). Deutsche Bank has set itself the goal of increasing the total volume of sustainable supply chain financing to 1 billion euros by the end of 2022.</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Sustainability is an integral part of Henkel's strategic growth agenda.

Not only are we presenting the best results in a decade; we are also proposing a meaningful dividend for the first time in years. This return to attractive shareholder distributions comes after years of being unable to reward our shareholders for their loyalty in the way that we aspire to.</p>\\n<p>More than just opening a new chapter, today also marks the end of an era as we bid farewell to two highly esteemed colleagues after the AGM. As announced some time ago, our Supervisory Board Chairman Paul Achleitner will not be standing for re-election. In addition, our Chief Risk Officer Stuart Lewis decided last year that the 2022 general meeting would mark the end of what has been a long and successful career at Deutsche Bank.</p>\\n<p>Our bank owes a great deal to both of them. In fact, without them we would not be the bank we are today: strong, stable, sustainably profitable and with excellent prospects.</p>\\n<p>When Paul Achleitner took over as Chairman of our Supervisory Board in 2012, our bank was only strong and stable on the surface. It has taken many years of profound changes to get Deutsche Bank back on track.</p>\\n<p>Paul Achleitner took on this task and, despite some setbacks, fought wholeheartedly to achieve this goal. He created the conditions that enabled us to consistently resolve legacy issues and to gradually restore confidence in our bank. Paul Achleitner played a key role in setting the pace for our bank&rsquo;s transformation, which he has helped to drive forward with great foresight. When things got difficult, he was a rock.</p>\\n<p>All that came at a price. Time and again, our outgoing Supervisory Board Chairman put the bank&rsquo;s interests above his own. On various occasions, he became a scapegoat for the bank, taking criticism for things that had happened long before he took office.</p>\\n<p>I am saying goodbye today to a man to whom I owe a lot &ndash; a man who has been a valued companion, mentor, advisor and sparring partner. That man is Paul Achleitner. Without him, our transformation efforts over the past years would not have been possible. Without him, we on the Management Board might never have made what were very difficult decisions.</p>\\n<p>I have also enjoyed a very long partnership with Stuart Lewis, as have many colleagues. Stuart worked for our bank for 26 years, the last ten of which as a member of the Management Board. Throughout his outstanding career, Stuart made a decisive contribution at many crucial points, enabling our bank to navigate major challenges safely and successfully. The great financial crisis after the Lehman bankruptcy, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the Covid pandemic and, most recently, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are the most prominent, but far from the only examples.</p>\\n<p>Stuart played a decisive role in helping us develop a strong risk culture in our bank, with sharper risk awareness in all business areas. This has been one of the key foundations for our successful transformation in recent years. Stuart has shaped the bank\\'s culture in other ways too, with a passionate commitment to diversity and inclusion, notably as Executive Sponsor for dbPride in the UK &amp; Ireland. His commitment to diversity in our bank has been recognised repeatedly.</p>\\n<p>Stuart\\'s success is also reflected in facts and figures. For many years, our exposure to credit and market risks has been consistently lower than most of our peers. It is also expressed in awards and accolades: in the past ten years, specialist publication risk.net named Deutsche Bank \"Risk Manager of the Year\" four times and, most recently, for a remarkable two consecutive years.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We will miss Paul Achleitner and Stuart Lewis. At the same time, we count ourselves fortunate to have two new colleagues, both with decades of experience in leading positions in the global financial industry: Alex Wynaendts, Chairman designate of our Supervisory Board; and Olivier Vigneron, our new Chief Risk Officer.

Starting in July this year, every new or extended contract worth over 500,000 euros a year will require an external vendor sustainability rating from EcoVadis or another eligible rating agency. These are: MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, S&amp;P Global und CDP.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank spends more than 8 billion euros a year on products and services from third-party vendors and aims to use its significant purchasing power to drive greater ESG accountability and transparency across the supply chain and to ensure that all suppliers meet the highest environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements.</p>\\n<p>As each supplier also has a network of interconnected suppliers, the policy should create a ripple effect, according to Alf Noto, Chief Procurement Officer at Deutsche Bank.\\u202f&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Sustainability is a collective responsibility,&rdquo; Noto says. &ldquo;We want to collaborate with suppliers to help make a positive impact to extend the reach and impact of our ESG footprint.&rdquo;\\u202f</p>\\n<p>Suppliers will need to register with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://invite.ecovadis.com/en/deutsche-bank/\" target=\"_blank\">EcoVadis</a> to undergo ESG assessment. The agency&rsquo;s comprehensive rating is based on a confidential sustainability questionnaire and evidence. The process gives companies a score out of 100. This will help suppliers identify improvement areas and allows them to use their ESG rating with other customers.\\u202f</p>\\n<p>From the beginning of 2023, it will no longer suffice for Deutsche Bank suppliers to have undergone ESG assessment. From this date onwards, the bank will only grant new contracts worth over 500,000 euros a year to vendors who have an adequately high sustainability rating &ndash; in the case of EcoVadis, this means achieving at least 25 of the 100 possible points.\\u202f</p>\\n<p>The EcoVadis partnership follows the recent launch of the revised&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vendor-portal.db.com/working-together/vendor-code-of-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">Supplier Code of Conduct</a> which sets out the bank&rsquo;s expectations for suppliers and reflects its ESG principles. The bank said in May 2020 that it aims to facilitate over 200 billion euros in sustainable finance and investments and has since moved this target forward twice to end 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Global Procurement is a great example of how we are moving from ambition to impact and partnering with our vendors to cover our whole value chain,&rdquo; said J&ouml;rg Eigendorf, Head of Sustainability at Deutsche Bank.\\u202f\\u202f&ldquo;This is a big step to gradually improve the sustainability of our value chain.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>A number of ESG rating agencies have recently recognised the bank&rsquo;s progress. EcoVadis commended the bank for being &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; in sustainable procurement, while CDP raised the bank&rsquo;s climate change score from C to B. Credit ratings provider S&amp;P Global scored Deutsche Bank 60 points, putting it back in the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index.

FinLync&rsquo;s pre-built API integrations and SAP-embedded treasury applications will enable corporate treasury and finance teams to connect to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s API offerings rapidly and easily.</p>\\n<p>FinLync&rsquo;s technology directly embeds up-to-the-moment bank data into any enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform or treasury management system (TMS), enabling plug-and-play access to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s comprehensive suite of innovative APIs.

However, ambitions are often yet to be transformed into reality as many corporates worry about the complexity of API integration across multiple banks, regions, and entities. The new partnership addresses this concern and will provide simple, fast, multi-bank connectivity.</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Our integration with FinLync makes it much easier for corporates to adopt our banking APIs and shortcut the road to automated, real-time treasury,&rdquo; says Kerstin Montiegel, Global Head Client Connectivity / Digital Client Access Channels at Deutsche Bank. &ldquo;FinLync&rsquo;s pre-built API integrations and SAP-native applications significantly reduce the complexity of building and maintaining individual API integrations with SAP and other ERPs for our clients.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>Phillip Klein, co-founder and CEO of FinLync, said: &ldquo;We are excited to join forces with Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s renowned Corporate API Program. We will support its clients by making bank API connectivity a simple plug-and-play experience, enabling corporates to manage liquidity in real-time and ultimately supporting faster, more-informed decision-making&rdquo;. He added: &ldquo;Corporate finance teams have long sought the ability to access all their available bank data and deliver it directly into their existing systems. We are delighted to partner with Deutsche Bank, a global leader in API-based corporate banking, to make this a reality.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>The partnership demonstrates Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s commitment to developing bank APIs that foster efficient and strategic actions, as well as FinLync&rsquo;s position as the global market leader in multi-bank Application Programming Interface (API) connectivity and ERP-native apps. Both parties plan to co-innovate and broaden the range of pre-integrated Deutsche Bank APIs to additional use cases, including eBAM and expanding the applications of beneficiary account validation.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-bank.de/finlync\">https://www.deutsche-bank.de/finlync</a><a href=\"https://www.deutsche-bank.de/finlync\"></a></p>\\n<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;API-enabled benefits such as improved cash forecasting and workflow automation rank as top treasury priorities for 2022.

For example, how to become more self-sufficient with regards to energy-supplies in light of spiking energy prices. Through our in-house expertise and our comprehensive suite of sustainable financing products, we&rsquo;re able to support these efforts.</p>\\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220509-lift-off-for-basf-wind-farm-project?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">we recently assisted BASF Group in the acquisition and construction of the world\\'s largest offshore wind farm</a> off the Dutch coast and structured the financing of the complex project. This transaction was groundbreaking in many respects. At a time when energy security is being discussed everywhere, this is the first time that a company has invested significantly in a wind farm itself in order to reduce its dependence on third parties. At the same time, it is an important step for BASF to become climate-neutral by 2050. But also smaller companies are looking into ways of becoming more energy self-sufficient.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/3_BASF_Windpark_Nl.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"Windpark in the sea\" width=\"795\" height=\"530\" /></p>\\n<p><strong>What is one of the biggest challenges here?</strong></p>\\n<p>Clients would prefer a checklist: one set of rules they can adhere to in implementing ESG, but that doesn&rsquo;t exist. ESG is still an evolving field, so we don&rsquo;t yet have standardised regulation, frameworks or even definitions. For example, we all talk about &ldquo;transition finance&rdquo;, but different stakeholders interpret and use the term in different ways.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">Clients would prefer a checklist: one set of rules they can adhere to in implementing ESG, but that doesn&rsquo;t exist</blockquote>\\n<p>On top of that, regulatory frameworks differ by jurisdiction, but our clients are global; what we really need is a level playing field internationally with clear, standardised ESG parameters.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you work around that?</strong></p>\\n<p>Standardisation will take time. However, we cannot wait for everything to be sorted before we begin. Yes, there are risks involved with getting started before things have been set in stone, but there are also risks to playing catch up if things move too far ahead without you. ESG is moving fast and there are tremendous opportunities for innovation within this field.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">We cannot wait for everything to be sorted before we begin</blockquote>\\n<p>In fact, ESG and sustainability offer many opportunities even beyond innovation. Through ESG, clients can engage in new markets, strengthen connections with current customers, attract new ones, and deepen their relationships with employees. We&rsquo;ve seen clients come up with very creative ideas and new business opportunities solely from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R5fe1vsQQw\" target=\"_blank\">their focus on transforming to a more sustainable business model</a>. Not to mention the technological innovation that is coming out of this space.</p>\\n<p><strong>How receptive are Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s clients to these ESG conversations?</strong></p>\\n<p>There is huge interest from clients who want a better understanding of how sustainability impacts their business activities, and how banks and capital markets are looking at ESG criteria. Many clients in high carbon emitting industries are already well aware of the need to define their transition strategies, and are developing plans to adapt their business models.</p>\\n<p>For many others, navigating the pandemic was their primary focus over the last two years, and they are just beginning to assess relevant sustainability drivers. Clients are looking for our view to help them understand the regulatory environment, investor perspectives and how ESG is impacting their industry. Part of our role as coverage teams is to accompany our clients on implementing their ESG strategy, and to understand on which pathways they are looking to transition. We help to finance their specific needs.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/Lavinia Bauerochse im Interview.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"Lavinia Bauerochse giving an Interview\" /></p>\\n<p><strong>What about Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s own ESG efforts?</strong></p>\\n<p>Our ambition is to be a leader in sustainability and ESG. We were the first bank to join H2Global, a German initiative facilitating hydrogen imports into Europe, as a founding member, and are also a founding member of the German-Australian hydrogen alliance. Deutsche Bank was also the first bank to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220223-deutsche-bank-ocean-resilience-philanthropy-fund-opens-for-contributions?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">join the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA)</a> as a full member.</p>\\n<p>We have integrated sustainable finance in an already comprehensive product suite, making it ESG compliant. In the Corporate Bank, we have a full range of our treasury toolkit available in an ESG compliant way to provide access to sustainable financing solutions including capital markets. And we are keen to provide solutions for clients with regards to capital expenditure (CapEx) investments &ndash; funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, buildings, technology, or equipment &ndash; which are required in financing ESG transition.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">Every client with financing needs will have ESG questions come up at some point</blockquote>\\n<p>Every client with financing needs will have ESG questions come up at some point, so all client-facing employees must understand ESG and its drivers and be competent in this space. This means that employee training in ESG is paramount, not only in coverage but also the product development and processing space.</p>\\n<p>Looking inwards,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220304-deutsche-bank-provides-disclosure-on-financed-co2-emissions-and-updates-on-net-zero-target-setting?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank recently disclosed the financed emissions of our overall corporate loan portfolio</a> for the first time, showcasing our current status and the financed emissions that we are currently supporting. This is a significant first step in providing transparency. It also highlights why it is important to understand the targets our clients have set themselves, because they impact our own ESG targets. We have also re-affirmed our commitment to publish 2050 net zero targets for our key carbon intensive portfolios, together with intermediate targets for 2030, by the end of this year.</p>\\n<p>And looking forward, we have just announced that we are arranging the first sustainability-linked supply chain finance programme for one of our clients.</p>\\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next for ESG financing and regulation?</strong></p>\\n<p>A transition to net zero will require significant investments in CapEx, and in transforming and decarbonising business models. Some of these will be new investments, while others will be reallocations that go towards sustainable process developments or less GHG intensive processes. This will create a lot of innovation across the industries, with new technological advances and collaboration across the field, which is particularly exciting. Having so many stakeholders from different disciplines working collaboratively on ESG solutions is something outstanding in the field of sustainable financing and ESG.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">A transition to net zero will require significant investments in&nbsp;(...) decarbonising business models</blockquote>\\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also see more dialogue around responsible ownership and wind downs with regards to carbon intensive assets. In the past, some actors sought to improve their emissions by selling carbon intensive assets. However, the question is whether a sell-off and continued operation by other operators really leads to responsible decarbonization, as gray or private markets are less transparent or supervised &ndash; so this will not necessarily help us achieve net zero.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In terms of regulation, we expect more clarity and detail from the European Union this year with regards to their social taxonomy and, later on, transition taxonomy. So, we&rsquo;ll have more standardised guidelines on what is considered Social criteria, for example. We&rsquo;ll also see green bond standardisation introduced, which will be a gold standard for green bonds moving forward.</p>\\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a heavy emphasis on the &lsquo;E&rsquo; of ESG &ndash; how are we delivering on the &lsquo;S&rsquo; and the &lsquo;G&rsquo;?</strong></p>\\n<p>Europe has traditionally focused on decarbonisation, which is only one aspect of the &lsquo;E&rsquo;. Our focus is now broadening to include more environmental aspects, such as biodiversity and soil sealing, which are strongly linked to climate change.</p>\\n<p>However, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have created a real need for action on many social issues. We have seen the devastating effects these events have had on various groups of people; for example, children, whose education and mental health have been severely affected. We see more clients creating initiatives and projects to address this.</p>\\n<p>In fact, clients are now beginning to link their performance towards environmental, social and governance targets with their financing, which we are able to support through sustainability-linked transactions and structures. This is where a client sets ESG targets they want to improve on and integrates them into their financing, underlining their commitment to their sustainability strategy.</p>', 'url': '/content.8ffc63db-7482-4ea3-950b-0ee515c2bf81', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Georg-M Berger', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220518-meet-our-esg-experts-lavinia-bauerochse', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'user-c1d4de3f-849d-402a-a7a5-940dc0f0cb42', 'imageSmall': '9279c3a1-613c-47aa-89b7-cbcdcebaf41f', 'secondReadingBox': '<p>This interview series is part of our new external newsletter \"ESG Quarterly\", to which <a href=\"https://db.com/newsletter/subscription?language_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">you can subscribe on our website db.com</a>.<br /><br /></p>', 'excerpt': 'Lavinia leads our sustainability efforts in the Corporate Bank and is a member of the Corporate Bank Executive Committee.

Lack of awareness, social stigma and resulting discrimination means that they often face severe hardship and are compelled to resort to begging or prostitution to fend for themselves.</p>\\n<p>Seema managed to find work as a domestic helper with a monthly salary of 1,000 rupees (around 12.50 euros). Eight years later and after a difficult marriage, Seema took charge of her life. She moved out of her house with savings of 20,000 rupees (around 245 euros) and was lucky to find work in a beauty salon, where she discovered her calling to become a beautician.</p>\\n<p>With her desire to finish her secondary education, Seema approached many schools but was denied admission. Then she found Masoom&rsquo;s GSPM Night School in Mumbai. She attended classes virtually during the pandemic and has just done her tenth-grade exams. While she eagerly awaits her results, she has enrolled herself in a six-month hair and beauty course. Deutsche Bank has committed to providing Seema with seed money of 150,000 rupees (around 1,800 euros) to open her own beauty salon once she has finished her course. &ldquo;I have always had a strong desire to be self-reliant, I now have hope to realise all my dreams!&rdquo; says Seema.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/IDAHOT-Transgender-India2.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"IDAHOT-Transgender-India\" /></p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank supports Masoom&rsquo;s Night School Transformation Programme as part of its CSR In the Community programme. The programme pays for the secondary schooling of adults who have either dropped out or have never attended school. This allows them to work during the day to financially support themselves. Over the last six years, the bank has provided infrastructure, resources and capacity building for the school, positively impacting the lives of more than 6,600 adults.</p>\\n<p>In another community outreach programme during the pandemic, the bank distributed 230 hygiene and sanitation kits to members of the transgender community in Mumbai and Delhi.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'url': '/content.ca7bc118-457c-4dcb-8274-497d30d2717b', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220517-transgender-in-india-seema-s-journey-from-hardship-to-hope', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': '2797d4b0-2003-4032-a9ed-c6d0be27cf92'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-05-13 12:33:43.76', 'publishDate': '2022-05-13 01:00:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'jenny.voigtlaender@db.com', 'title': 'US recession by end-2023?

It has brought terrible suffering to the country&rsquo;s people and is having a huge impact elsewhere, too. We condemned the invasion emphatically and unequivocally. As announced, we are in the process of winding down our business in Russia. At the same time, along with many of you, our bank has been lending support in a variety of ways to the victims of this war, to the many refugees and also to our colleagues in Ukraine. I would like to thank you very much for your tremendous generosity and solidarity.</p>\\n<p>These recent weeks and months have also shown that our bank performs particularly well during challenging times. As we outlined at our Investor Deep Dive on March 10, we have also shown we have everything it takes to be a Global Hausbank. With our first-class risk management and focus on all four business divisions, we offer our clients a global network combined with local expertise, along with our leading products and solutions. We have helped our clients manage their risks and have provided them with the short to long-term financing that they desperately need right now. And we are supporting government actions, on the one hand by unreservedly implementing the sanctions against Russia, on the other by exchanging views on the economic consequences of this war.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank is more stable and resilient than it has been for many years. Our figures for the first quarter demonstrate this clearly. Despite the difficult environment, we once again managed to increase our net revenues over what was already a strong quarter in the previous year, reaching 7.3 billion euros this quarter. Since we were also able to further reduce costs, we generated more profit than in the same period last year: profit before tax rose by 4 percent to 1.7 billion euros, while net profit was 1.2 billion euros, an increase of 18 percent. This has been the best start to the year since 2013. We can all be proud of this achievement!</p>\\n<p>It is particularly pleasing that our growth this quarter is once again driven by all four core businesses. Year-on-year, we achieved higher revenues and profit across the board:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In the Corporate Bank, business growth continued despite the more challenging market. We saw this reflected in loans which were up by 3 billion euros in the quarter and by 8 billion euros year-on-year. The interest rate environment in many regions improved further, with US, non-euro EMEA and Asia now more than offsetting remaining negative effects of low interest rates in the Eurozone. Overall, the Corporate Bank increased its net revenues by 11 percent. This, combined with a reduction in non-interest expenses of 7 percent, helped us to deliver a 25 percent year-on-year increase in profit before tax.</li>\\n<li>In the Investment Bank, profit before tax rose slightly by 1 percent compared to the strong prior-year quarter. Net revenues were up by 7 percent thanks to strong client demand in Fixed Income &amp; Currencies (FIC) Sales &amp; Trading. This more than compensated for a decline in revenues from our Origination &amp; Advisory business where we saw a decline in client activity in capital markets due to the uncertain geopolitical and economic situation. An exception was in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) which increased revenues by more than 80 percent.</li>\\n<li>The Private Bank was able to absorb the negative effects of low euro interest rates and grow revenues, thanks in part to successive quarters of business volume growth. Net revenues rose by 2 percent. This was mainly due to an increase of 4 percent in the International Private Bank, but the Private Bank Germany also grew its revenues. Profit before tax in the Private Bank rose by more than half and was the highest of any quarter since we launched our transformation programme &ndash; a clear sign of how we improved efficiency here. We took a further step in this direction in mid-April, when four million Postbank clients who exclusively use savings products were all migrated to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s IT platform. By the beginning of next year all of Postbank's client connections are to follow.</li>\\n<li>In Asset Management, assets under management fell for the first time in eight quarters owing to the price slide in many markets, and investors withdrew a net 1 billion euros from DWS products. However, this was mainly due to outflows in low-margin cash products. Excluding Cash, net inflows were 5.7 billion euros, with substantial net inflows into Active (ex-Cash) products and inflows into Alternatives and Passive products. ESG funds attracted inflows of 1.1 billion euros. In addition, net revenues grew by 7 percent, primarily driven by higher management fees, and profit before tax was up 12 percent.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Our Capital Release Unit rounds off this quarter&rsquo;s positive picture. Here we were able to further reduce leverage exposure and risk-weighted assets. At the same time, we continued to cut costs, reducing the unit&rsquo;s loss before tax by 17 percent year on year.</p>\\n<p>These are all impressive results; we have shown our strengths in difficult circumstances. And importantly, we have still managed to remain disciplined on costs. We were able to reduce adjusted costs (excluding transformation charges and bank levies) by a further 3 percent to 4.6 billion euros. If currency effects are excluded, the reduction was 5 percent. One of the factors contributing to this was that our investments in more efficient technology are increasingly paying off. We will need to maintain this discipline in the coming months.</p>\\n<p>Of course, we must also keep an eye on the growing risks. The global economic outlook is deteriorating, while inflation rates continue to rise. This is reflected in our results; we increased our credit loss provisions in the first quarter. There were no major defaults yet, but we are now better equipped to absorb possible defaults in future. We have an excellent loan book, strong risk management and a solid capital base. At the end of the first quarter, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) was 12.8 percent and thus above our target of 12.5 percent.</p>\\n<p>We are convinced that we are well prepared for more difficult times. The good start to the year gives us further confidence that we will achieve our targets for the current year. With a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8.1 percent, we exceeded our year-end target of 8 percent in the first quarter. At 73 percent, the cost-income ratio is also not far shy of our 70 percent target &ndash; even though we booked almost all of the bank levies for the entire year in the first three months, and these were significantly higher than in the previous year.</p>\\n<p>This business success is the indispensable prerequisite for us to be able to live up to our responsibility for our clients, the economy, and society as a whole.</p>\\n<p>Together, we have achieved great things, as we have done in every quarter since we announced our new strategy in mid-2019. In March, we announced the start of the next stage and, as before, we set ourselves ambitious goals that we know we can achieve. Our first quarter results have shown us that again.</p>\\n<p>Best wishes,<br /> <br /> Christian Sewing</p>\", 'url': '/content.f2338700-314b-44ce-8dd8-57b7fd91201a', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Jacques Regnier', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220427-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-q1-results-2022', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.3032', 'imageSmall': 'f484a65a-3afc-491d-ac89-ce107618bc0e'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-05-18 16:02:09.687', 'publishDate': '2022-04-27 07:00:00.0', 'imageLarge': '89baa7f4-459e-4953-b71e-7c18e7eb65c4', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank reports € 1.7 billion profit before tax in the first quarter of 2022', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'ad9f7716-3062-49b5-8274-f0995124bd97', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank reports € 1.7 billion profit before tax in the first quarter of 2022', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4958', 'identifier': '0250bcdb-91b7-4637-a297-3a2e9041143e', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220127-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-our-full-year-results-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"A message from Christian Sewing on our full-year results 2021\">A message from Christian Sewing on our full-year results 2021</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220127-annual-media-conference-2022?language_id=1\" title=\"Annual Media Conference 2022\">Annual Media Conference 2022</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20211027-deutsche-bank-reports-profit-before-tax-of-EUR-554-million-in-the-third-quarter-of-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports profit before tax of &euro;

All our businesses delivered results in line with or ahead of our targets, and we produced our highest quarterly profit for nine years.<span class=\"author\">CEO Christian Sewing</span></blockquote>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced profit before tax of &euro; 1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2022, up 4% year on year. Post-tax profit was up 18% to &euro; 1.2 billion, the highest quarterly post-tax profit since 2013. This result was achieved despite a 28% increase in Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s annual bank levies to &euro; 730 million, recognised in the first quarter.</p>\\n<p>Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity was 7.2% in the quarter, while post-tax return on average tangible shareholders&rsquo; equity (RoTE)1 was 8.1%, up from 7.4% in the prior year quarter. The cost/income ratio improved to 73%, from 77% in the first quarter of 2021.</p>\\n<p>Assuming an equal distribution of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s annual bank levies across the four quarters of 2022 and a three-month pro rata (three twelfths) share in the first quarter, pre-tax profit would have been &euro; 2.2 billion in the quarter. Post-tax RoTE&sup1;&nbsp;would have been 11.2%, compared to the bank&rsquo;s full year 2022 target of 8%, and the cost/income ratio would have been 66% versus the full year target of 70%.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"quote-box\">In a challenging environment, we delivered both revenue and profit growth across all core businesses.

We believe this momentum, combined with continued cost discipline and organic capital generation, positions us well for delivery on our 2022 targets.<span class=\"author\">James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer</span></blockquote>\\n<h2>Core Bank: profit growth across all businesses</h2>\\n<p>In the Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, profit before tax was &euro; 2.0 billion, essentially unchanged year on year, despite a year on year rise of &euro; 184 million in bank levies to &euro; 587 million. Revenues grew 3% to &euro; 7.3 billion, noninterest expenses were down 1% to &euro; 5.0 billion, and adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies were down 1% to &euro; 4.4 billion.</p>\\n<p>Post-tax RoTE&sup1; was 10.7%, higher than the Core Bank&rsquo;s full year 2022 target of above 9% and compared to 10.9% in the first quarter of 2021. The year on year development reflected growth in tangible equity. The cost/income ratio was 69%, versus 71% in the prior year quarter. Assuming a three-month pro rata (three twelfths) share of full year bank levies, Core Bank post-tax ROTE&sup1; would have been 13.4% and cost/income ratio would have been 63%.</p>\\n<p>The core businesses contributed as follows to the bank&rsquo;s key target ratios:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank: post-tax RoTE&sup1; of 7.2% and cost/income ratio of 70%</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank: post-tax RoTE&sup1; of 16.8% and cost/income ratio of 53%</li>\\n<li>Private Bank: post-tax RoTE&sup1; of 9.1% and cost/income ratio of 77%</li>\\n<li>Asset Management: post-tax RoTE&sup1; of 25.4% and cost/income ratio of 62%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>The Capital Release Unit</h2>\\n<p>The Capital Release Unit maintained its progress on portfolio reduction. Leverage exposure was reduced by &euro; 4 billion to &euro; 35 billion during the first quarter, and Risk weighted assets (RWAs) were down a further &euro; 3 billion to &euro; 25 billion, including operational risk RWAs of &euro; 19 billion. The Capital Release Unit remains ahead of its year-end 2022 targets for both leverage exposure and RWA reduction and has cut leverage exposure by 86% and RWAs by 61% since its creation in mid-2019.</p>\\n<p>The Capital Release Unit reduced its loss before tax to &euro; 339 million, down 17% from a loss before tax of &euro; 410 million in the first quarter of 2021. The improvement was driven primarily by cost reduction, with noninterest expenses down 32% year on year to &euro; 337 million. This reduction more than offset the non-recurrence of net revenues which primarily reflects the cessation of revenues from Prime Finance cost recovery after the completion of the transfer of Prime Finance to BNP Paribas at the end of 2021.</p>\\n<h2>Revenue growth across all core businesses</h2>\\n<p>Net revenues were &euro; 7.3 billion, up 1% over the prior year quarter and the highest since the first quarter of 2017. Revenue growth in Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s core businesses more than offset negative revenues in the Capital Release Unit and Corporate &amp; Other. In the core businesses, net revenues were as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank net revenues were &euro; 1.5 billion, up 11% year on year, the highest since the launch of the transformation programme and the second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenues in Corporate Treasury Services were up 14%, Institutional Client Services revenues rose 11% and Business Banking revenues were up 1%. Revenues were driven in part by business growth, with deposits up 5% and gross loans up 7% over the prior year quarter.</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank net revenues were &euro; 3.3 billion, up 7% over a strong first quarter of 2021. Fixed Income &amp; Currencies (FIC) revenues grew 15%, driven by strong Financing, Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets which more than offset a decline in Credit Trading. This growth in FIC revenues more than offset a 28% decline in Origination &amp; Advisory revenues, driven by a significant year on year decline in Equity Origination which reflected lower industry fee pools against a backdrop of economic and geo-political uncertainties.</li>\\n<li>Private Bank net revenues were &euro; 2.2 billion, up 2% year on year. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany were up 1%, while the International Private Bank grew revenues by 4% over the prior year quarter. Net new business volumes were &euro; 13 billon, predominantly net inflows into investment products of &euro; 9 billion and net new client loans of &euro; 3 billion, which are expected to contribute to revenue growth in future quarters.</li>\\n<li>Asset Management net revenues rose 7% to &euro; 682 million. A 13% rise in management fees, to &euro; 621 million, more than offset a decline of 34% in performance and transaction fees which reflected the non-recurrence of a substantial performance fee in the prior year quarter. Net outflows were &euro; 1 billion, driven by Cash and Fixed Income products; net inflows ex-Cash were &euro; 5.7 billion. Assets under management were &euro; 902 billion at quarter-end, down 3% quarter on quarter but up 10%, or &euro; 82 billion, year on year.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Sustainable Finance: further progress and accelerated targets</h2>\\n<p>Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes&sup2; were &euro; 20 billion ex-DWS in the quarter, bringing the cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to &euro; 177 billion. In the first quarter, Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s businesses contributed as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank: &euro; 4 billion in sustainable financing, raising the business&rsquo; cumulative total since January 1, 2020 to &euro; 30 billion;</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank: &euro; 11 billion in sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of &euro; 98 billion;</li>\\n<li>Private Bank: &euro; 4 billion growth in ESG assets under management and a further &euro; 1 billion in ESG new client lending, raising the Private Bank&rsquo;s cumulative total to &euro; 50 billion.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At its Investor Deep Dive on March 10, 2022, Deutsche Bank announced an acceleration of its targets for sustainable financing and investment volumes for the second time. The bank now aims to achieve cumulative volumes since January 2020 of over &euro; 200 billion by the end of 2022, a year earlier than previously, and a further &euro; 100 billion per year from 2023 to 2025, reaching a cumulative total of over &euro; 500 billion by the end of 2025. The bank expects net revenues arising from the volumes categorised under Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Framework to be in excess of &euro; 1.5 billion in 2025.</p>\\n<h2>Expenses: year on year reductions despite higher bank levies</h2>\\n<p>Noninterest expenses were &euro; 5.4 billion in the quarter, down 4% year on year, despite the aforementioned rise in annual bank levies of &euro; 159 million to &euro; 730 million. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and bank levies1 were down 3% to &euro; 4.6 billion. By the end of the first quarter, Deutsche Bank had recognised 98% of the total transformation-related effects anticipated through end-2022.</p>\\n<h2>Credit provisions: year on year growth reflects macroeconomic developments</h2>\\n<p>Provision for credit losses was &euro; 292 million in the quarter, up from &euro; 69 million in the first quarter of 2021. This development was driven by provision for performing (Stage 1 and 2) loans of &euro; 178 million, compared to net releases of &euro; 95 million in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting rating migrations and overlays to reflect macro-economic uncertainties. This increase was partly offset by a 30% decline in provision for non-performing (Stage 3) loans to &euro; 114 million, partly reflecting a small number of larger releases in the Investment Bank.</p>\\n<h2>Russia exposure further reduced in the quarter</h2>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank further reduced its Russian credit exposures during the quarter:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Gross loan exposure was cut by 5% to &euro; 1.3 billion, with de minimis onshore exposure and exposures to Russian subsidiaries of multi-national corporations largely guaranteed by parent companies;</li>\\n<li>Net loan exposure decreased 21% to &euro; 0.5 billion during the quarter, reflecting active exposure management and repayments;</li>\\n<li>Additional contingent risk was reduced by 35% to &euro; 1.0 billion in the quarter. Undrawn commitments were reduced to &euro; 0.8 billion and are largely mitigated by Export Credit Agency coverage and contractual drawdown protection. Guarantees were reduced by two thirds to &euro; 0.2 billion, largely due to roll-offs.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Ruble cash balances with the Central Bank of Russia were &euro; 0.9 billion at the end of the quarter, predominantly reflecting deposits from existing clients. All major derivative exposures have been unwound and market risk exposure to Russia remains low. The bank has implemented the sanctions policies adopted by Western governments and continues to take care of local employees and to invest in the management of technology, cyber and other risks. The local balance sheet of Deutsche Bank Moscow was unchanged at &euro; 1.5 billion and the local capital position of &euro; 0.2 billion was fully FX hedged.</p>\\n<h2>Support for Ukraine</h2>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank remains operational in Ukraine and has taken action to support its local employees and their families. The bank and its employees have offered support for Ukraine through initiatives which include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A donation of &euro; 1 million by the bank, supplemented by donations of more than &euro; 500,000 from employees, to support relief efforts by the Red Cross, the International Medical Corps and other aid organisations working on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries;</li>\\n<li>Supporting Wellcome, a German charity helping Ukrainian mothers and their children fleeing to Germany, through the bank&rsquo;s payroll giving scheme;</li>\\n<li>Offering free current accounts with simplified opening procedures agreed with the Federal Government for Ukrainian refugees arriving in Germany, and reimbursing transaction fees on money transfers to Ukraine;</li>\\n<li>Providing technology expertise in partnership with JobAidUkraine to roll out a free website helping Ukrainian refugees to find job opportunities.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Capital and liquidity in line with goals</h2>\\n<p>The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 12.8% at quarter end, down from 13.2% at the end of the previous quarter. Around half of this decline was driven by ECB mandated model adjustments. The decline further reflected business-related growth in risk weighted assets and the negative impact on ratings and higher prudent valuation adjustments resulting from the war in Ukraine. Strong organic capital generation through net income was largely offset by share repurchases, deductions for common share dividends, future Additional Tier 1 (AT1) coupon payments and equity compensation.</p>\\n<p>By the end of the first quarter, Deutsche Bank had completed around 50% of its &euro; 300 million share repurchase for termination, announced on January 26 as part of the bank&rsquo;s aim to distribute approximately &euro; 700 million of capital to shareholders during 2022. This repurchase programme was completed in April.</p>\\n<p>The Leverage ratio was 4.6% in the first quarter, down from 4.9% at the end of the previous quarter. This development primarily reflected a &euro; 1.75 billion reduction in AT1 capital resulting from the bank&rsquo;s decision during the quarter to redeem AT1 notes issued in 2014, and growth in leverage exposure of 2% arising from loan growth and other business activity in the Core Bank.</p>\\n<p>Liquidity reserves were &euro; 246 billion at the end of the first quarter, versus &euro; 241 billion at the end of the previous quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of &euro; 214 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 135%, above the regulatory requirement of 100% and a surplus of &euro; 55 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 121%, above the bank&rsquo;s target range of 115-120%, with a surplus of &euro; 106 billion above required levels.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption\">&sup1;For a description of this and other non-GAAP financial measures, see &lsquo;Use of non-GAAP financial measures&rsquo; on pp 17-25 of the first quarter 2022 Financial Data Supplement and &ldquo;Non-GAAP financial measures&rdquo; on pp. 46-54 of the first quarter 2022 Earnings Report, respectively.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption\">&sup2;Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1, 2020 to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021.

Deutsche Bank is the leading bank in Germany with strong European roots and a global network.</p>\\n<h2>Forward-looking statements contain risks</h2>\\n<p>This release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of Deutsche Bank. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in the light of new information or future events.</p>\\n<p>By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.</p>\\n<p>Such factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of our assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, potential defaults of borrowers or trading counterparties, the implementation of our strategic initiatives, the reliability of our risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks referenced in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\\n<p>Such factors are described in detail in our SEC Form 20-F of 11 March 2022 under the heading &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo;.

For the same time period in 2021, the application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact of &euro; 316 million on profit before taxes and of &euro; 207 million on profit.</p>\\n<p>The Group&rsquo;s regulatory capital and ratios thereof are also reported on the basis of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, application of the EU carve-out had a positive impact on the CET1 capital ratio of about 3 basis points and a negative impact of about 6 basis point for the same time period in 2021. &nbsp;In any given period, the net effect of the EU carve-out can be positive or negative, depending on the fair market value changes in the positions being hedged and the hedging instruments.</p>\\n<h3>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h3>\\n<p>This report and other documents we have published or may publish contain non-GAAP financial measures.

Such charges include the transformation-related impairment of software and real estate, the accelerated software amortisation and other transformation charges like onerous contract provisions or legal and consulting fees related to the strategy execution.</li>\\n<li>Transformation-related effects are financial impacts resulting from the strategy announced on July 7, 2019. These include transformation charges, goodwill impairments in the second quarter 2019, as well as restructuring and severance expenses from the third quarter 2019 onwards.

Given the cumulative definition of our target, in cases where validation against the Framework cannot be completed before the end of the reporting quarter, volumes are reported upon completion of the validation in subsequent quarters.</p>\\n<p>In Asset Management, DWS introduced its ESG Product Classification Framework (&ldquo;ESG Framework&rdquo;) in 2021 taking into account relevant legislation (including Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 &ndash; SFDR), market standards and internal developments. The ESG Framework is further described in the Annual Report 2021 of DWS under the heading &rdquo;Our Product Suite &ndash; Key Highlights / ESG Product Classification Framework&rdquo; which is available at <a href=\"https://group.dws.com/ir/reports-and-events/annual-report/\">https://group.dws.com/ir/reports-and-events/annual-report/</a>.

As we see even with the geo-political situation each country strives to be energy self-sufficient. The second sector is the technology sector in other growth counties apart from China. We&rsquo;re seeing a lot of demand for financing not only the private equity capital but now credit capital which would help fund these technological innovation companies into the next stage of growth.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What risks remain for investors in Asia Pacific?</em></p>\\n<p>A: The western world has not seen inflation which is at a forty year high.

How does this sector pan out, its roughly about 175 billion US dollar credit outstanding. How does it pan out, what are the recovery values that people derive in the year or years to come will determine the risk factors for this region.</p>\\n<p><em>Q: What are the biggest opportunities?</em></p>\\n<p>A: In more developed markets like Japan and Australia we&rsquo;re seeing this trend of large private equity acquisitions and LBO or leveraged financing that is taking shape. The other country which is exciting is India. Due to regulations that domestic capital cannot invest in certain growth companies and we see a little marriage of domestic capital and foreign capital that is addressing these concerns.</p>\\n<p>China remains a big country with a big focus currently disrupted with what has happened in the property sector. But again a new set of capital which specialises in distressed or special situations are seeing a myriad of opportunities out there.\"</p>', 'url': '/content.95856a21-f94f-4d1c-8971-b0e6c160a776', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220422-50-seconds-on-apac-asia-pacific-credit-markets', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': '2163bc4b-250b-438f-b914-50e7431c1a8e'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-04-22 03:46:45.557', 'publishDate': '2022-04-22 00:00:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'harikumar.rajasekhar@db.com', 'title': 'Gubataan: nurturing environmental champions in the Philippines', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '18d6450f-3d7a-480a-8755-7821acec28a6', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Gubataan: nurturing environmental champions in the Philippines', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'identifier': 'ac6809d6-02e3-48d5-8884-cf5d9c7fb08e', 'urlTitle': '20220422-gubataan-nurturing-environmental-champions-in-the-philippines', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220422-gubataan-nurturing-environmental-champions-in-the-philippines', 'richText': '<p>Deutsche Bank is partnering with Ashoka to run a series of environmental change-making camps for young people from marginalised communities in the Philippines.</p>\\n<p>Through the programme, called &lsquo;Gubataan: A Youth Forest&rsquo;, young people will spend 30-45 days immersed in nature camps learning about the natural environment, the importance of sustainable practices, and how to be a force for good for the planet.

Deutsche Bank and Postbank are stepping in with an effective solution, enabling refugees to open current accounts at their branches. In agreement with the Federal government, this is possible via a simplified form, with only a Ukrainian ID card required to open a basic account. There is no need for the proof of official registration usually required; applicants can simply provide a postal address such as their emergency accommodation.</p>\\n<p>In addition, the monthly fee will be waived for these accounts. The banks will also assist with private money transfers to people in Ukraine. For instance, Deutsche Bank and Postbank offers reimbursements of the regular transaction fee if refugees or even volunteers want to help people in Ukraine by transferring cash.<br /><br /></p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/03-mar/job-aid-for-ukrainian-refugees.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"Job aid for Ukrainian refugees\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\\n<h3>Job search site launched for Ukrainian refugees</h3>\\n<p>JobAidUkraine is a free-to-use website that encourages companies to post available jobs and matches them with Ukrainian refugees.

But times are not normal. Russia&rsquo;s military aggression against Ukraine was and still is a shock for Europe. It has deprived us of the illusion that such aggression can no longer be possible in today's Europe &ndash; and that economic interdependence and political dialogue are too intense for a large nation to completely abandon the existing world order.</p>\\n<p>We stand united with the people of Ukraine who are suffering from violence and destruction. Their morale, courage and will to defend is remarkable, they are fighting for a free Europe. Our thanks also go out these days to all those who are helping the millions of refugees and by doing so are helping to alleviate a little of the human suffering that this war is causing. We would also like to thank all our employees who have been donating or lending a hand directly.</p>\\n<h2>Economic impact of the war: Russia and banks&nbsp;</h2>\\n<p>The economic consequences of the war are, of course, also the dominant theme when the bodies of our association meet here in Berlin today. We have said from the outset that we fully support the Western sanctions against Russia. Implementing them consistently is a top priority for banks in Germany. This is a complex task in view of the comprehensive, multinational measures.</p>\\n<p>But for us there is no doubt: such a brutal war, which violates international law, must not remain without consequences. The sanctions are therefore justified in their unprecedented severity, and it is encouraging how quickly and united Europe and its transatlantic allies have acted here. The Russian economy&rsquo;s downward spiral of historic proportions is proof that the sanctions are having an impact.</p>\\n<p>It is, at this point, completely unclear what economic relations between Russia and Europe will look like in the future. A reversion to the status quo ante is barely conceivable. Many European and US banks have already announced their intention to withdraw from the Russian market. And unless the Kremlin radically changes its policy, this trend is certain to continue, in the financial sector as well as in other industries.</p>\\n<p>Let me also be clear in this context: the immediate economic risks of this situation are manageable for German banks, as they are for the European financial system as a whole. It was the right decision for German banks to start significantly scaling back their business in Russia as early as after 2014. As a result, exposure today is generally very limited.</p>\\n<p>At the same time, the European banking sector as a whole is very resilient, and capital buffers are now higher than ever. This is also important because the economic consequences of the war and sanctions can affect European countries in different ways, and our banks in Europe are part of a particularly strong network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Economic impact: business cycle&nbsp;</h2>\\n<p>The stability of the banking sector is also significant because the economy was already struggling beforehand. We have multiple risks to manage: the Covid pandemic is not over yet. Disrupted supply chains and raw material shortages have led to production losses worldwide and thrown sand in the gears of global trade relations. And even before the outbreak of the war, inflation had reached heights not seen since the beginning of monetary union. Added to this now are the war-related price effects on the commodity and food markets&ndash; and we cannot yet estimate the extent of this.</p>\\n<p>But it is already clear that the economy will suffer considerably. The chief economists of the private banks have halved their forecast compared with their estimates from before the war. The German economy is now only expected to grow by around two percent this year. A return to pre-pandemic levels will therefore be delayed further &ndash; both in Germany and in Europe.</p>\\n<p>Even this forecast is subject to reservations, as there are considerable risks that have not yet been factored into the calculation. First and foremost, these include energy prices: they are a burden for many companies and consumers. Even though the German government has now introduced relief measures, further price rises or acute bottlenecks could significantly slow down the economy.</p>\\n<p>Global supply and trade chains will also once again be put to the test. And not just because of the war; the new lockdown measures in China could lead to renewed production stoppages and supply bottlenecks. For the global economy, this would be a further major damper.</p>\\n<p>The situation would be even worse if imports or supplies of Russian oil and natural gas were to be halted. A significant recession in Germany would then be virtually unavoidable. The question of government aid measures for companies and industries would then become even more pressing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Economic effects: inflation&nbsp;</h2>\\n<p>These less than encouraging prospects are accompanied by further increases in inflation rates in the euro zone. At over seven percent, they are likely to reach levels in this half-year that were beyond our imagination only a short time ago. In the event of an energy embargo, even higher rates would be likely.</p>\\n<p>And with each passing month, there is a growing risk that this level will become entrenched, that there will be second and third-round effects, and that inflation expectations will rise.</p>\\n<p>Let me be clear: permanently high inflation rates are toxic for the stability of our economy. And not just because high rates of inflation unsettle businesses and consumers alike. It's also because the policy of cheap money has been accompanied by harmful redistributive effects for years. I already warned about this in 2019. Because the main beneficiaries are those who hold assets such as shares or real estate and have the necessary credit rating to take on debt. On the flip side, those who depend on state pensions and life insurance will lose out.</p>\\n<p>Now, with consumer prices rising, there is the threat of much more serious social dislocation. With inflation rates as they are, almost a quarter of households with a net income of less than 2,500 euros can barely keep up with their regular expenses. This was a finding in a recent survey initiated by Postbank, and it is alarming. I can therefore only warn against continuing with the policy of cheap money and exacerbating these redistribution effects with all their social implications.</p>\\n<p>This now presents central banks with a challenge the likes of which have not been seen for at least 30 years. They have to combat rising prices in a phase of economic uncertainty.</p>\\n<p>In the coming weeks and months, it will also be important for the European Central Bank to show that it has a firm grip on the reins and is prepared to take countermeasures. Despite all the uncertainties, there is much that speaks in favour of ending net bond purchases before the end of the year and sending out an initial signal on interest rates. By ending the negative interest rate policy, the ECB could limit a further rise in inflation expectations. It would send a clear signal to investors, labour unions and private households. A signal that is urgently needed.</p>\\n<h2>Consequences of the war for the EU</h2>\\n<p>This war is a test for the European Union &ndash; economically as well as politically. So far, the EU has passed this test. The European states are pulling together impressively and taking a unified stance. They can give the European Union a real boost and strengthen its structure.</p>\\n<p>We should seize this momentum. Perhaps this is the moment to strengthen Europe significantly and permanently. If we once again recognise that we are stronger together, we can &ndash; as unreal as it sounds at the moment &ndash; perhaps even emerge stronger from this crisis.</p>\\n<p>The European Union derives much of its strength and economic clout from the size of its single market. If we strengthen this single market wherever possible, we will be making a significant contribution to a stronger Europe, both economically and politically.</p>\\n<p>We need this economically stronger Europe more urgently than ever. Because the need for investment is enormous, and it has become even greater following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Climate protection, digitization, infrastructure, alliance and national defence &ndash; billions must be mobilised, month after month, for the major policy areas of the present and future.</p>\\n<p>Government investment will be indispensable in order to be able to manage the transformation process of the coming years. However, public budgets are already under considerable strain from the Covid pandemic and are being further stretched by the consequences of the war and the sanctions. The state's financial resources are limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Therefore, private investment will naturally be very important</h2>\\n<p>Particularly in the case of climate protection, smart government subsidy policies can provide an important boost. Nevertheless, a large part of the expenditure for new technologies and production processes must and will be financed privately. It is therefore clear that we need a financing architecture that makes it possible to mobilise unprecedented amounts of private funding.</p>\\n<p>This financing architecture must be a European one. And a key component of this is a European capital markets union that efficiently harnesses the huge potential of private capital in Europe. In the light of the new challenges, this is needed now more than ever. There is no more cost-effective economic stimulus package than a banking and capital markets union for Europe. To date, a fragmented European capital market prevents us from fully exploiting our financing options. We can quickly remove this stumbling block.</p>\\n<p>The European financial architecture we need also includes a stable and profitable banking sector that can reliably finance companies. The regulation of the coming years must therefore also be measured by whether it reduces banks' lending options or whether, ideally, it expands their scope. Ever higher payments to the Single Resolution Fund are therefore out of step with the times.</p>\\n<p>The same applies to the countercyclical capital buffer, which was increased at the beginning of the year &ndash; at that time still with a view to an expected recovery of the economy, i.e. in an environment that has since changed radically. All of this restricts banks' scope for lending. And this at a time when banks are particularly in demand as financiers of investments &ndash; especially in view of the imperfect European capital market.</p>\\n<p>When I took office last year, we focused on four economic policy issues for the Association of German Banks: competitive banks, strengthening capital market financing, our contribution to modernising the economy and more European integration.</p>\\n<p>These priorities have only become more pressing in recent weeks and months.</p>\\n<p>We banks can do a lot, as we proved during the Covid pandemic. And we want to continue to be part of the solution. But we can only fulfil this role in the long term if the framework for an efficient banking market is in place in a completed European banking union. This should be one of the guiding principles of European policy in the coming years.</p>\", 'url': '/content.f30e912d-c99a-4ef4-95b7-d712da7b24bd', 'titleImage': 'TITLE_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND', 'modUserName': 'Jacques Regnier', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220404-statement-to-media-by-christian-sewing-as-president-of-the-association-of-german-banks', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': False, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.3032'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-04-06 19:11:53.777', 'publishDate': '2022-04-04 03:15:00.0', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank’s virtual Annual General Meeting 2022 to be even more interactive – shareholders to receive dividend', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '5cc21689-672d-4e64-bc62-30aaa906535e', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank’s virtual Annual General Meeting 2022 to be even more interactive – shareholders to receive dividend', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4454', 'identifier': '2b4bd4c1-c077-4e5d-b885-8c831cbc2302', 'urlTitle': '20220404-deutsche-bank-s-virtual-annual-general-meeting-2022-to-be-even-more-interactive-shareholders-to-receive-dividend', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220404-deutsche-bank-s-virtual-annual-general-meeting-2022-to-be-even-more-interactive-shareholders-to-receive-dividend', 'richText': '<ul>\\n<li>Shareholders to receive dividend for the first time since 2018 financial year &ndash; Management Board and Supervisory Board propose 0.20 euros per share</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>AGM to vote on proposal to elect Alexander Wynaendts and Yngve Slyngstad to the Supervisory Board</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The entire Annual General Meeting (AGM) including the general debate and voting will again be available to watch live via a public webcast</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Chairman Paul Achleitner and CEO Christian Sewing&rsquo;s speeches are expected to be published on the bank&rsquo;s website on May 11, 2022</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Shareholders can again participate live via an interactive dialogue function and pre-submit statements.

This made it all the more important for us to further expand the opportunities for participation in order to make the virtual Annual General Meeting even more shareholder-friendly,\" said Paul Achleitner, Chairman of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Supervisory Board. \"I am delighted that the Management Board and the Supervisory Board can propose a dividend of 20 cents per share to the AGM,\" he added.</p>\\n<p>\"An Annual General Meeting thrives on the fullest possible exchange with our shareholders,\" added Management Board member Stefan Simon. \"That&rsquo;s why we were particularly keen to further develop the virtual AGM format in order to continue to strengthen the quality of the dialogue.

In total, this would correspond to a capital distribution to shareholders of around 700 million euros &ndash; a first step towards the recently expanded ambition to distribute 8 billion euros of capital to shareholders for the financial years 2021 to 2025. From 2025 onwards, the Management Board aims to distribute a total of 50 percent of the net profit attributable to shareholders.</p>\\n<p>The shareholders will also vote on the Supervisory Board&rsquo;s proposal to elect Alexander Wynaendts and Yngve Slyngstad as new shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board. As already announced in November, it is then planned to elect Wynaendts as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and therefore as successor to Paul Achleitner, who will not stand for re-election after 10 years and will thus leave the bank&rsquo;s Supervisory Board at the end of the AGM.</p>\\n<h2>Interactive participation in the AGM</h2>\\n<p>The AGM format provides ample opportunities for Deutsche Bank shareholders to exercise their rights.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The entire AGM, including the general debate and voting, will be broadcast live and available to the public on the bank&rsquo;s website at <a href=\"https://agm.db.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Deutsche Bank Annual General Meeting\">https://agm.db.com</a>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A forum will again be provided for shareholders&rsquo; statements on AGM topics.

Slyngstad would succeed Gerhard Eschelbeck, who will not stand for re-election when his five-year term ends at this year&rsquo;s AGM. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Slyngstad was CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the entity managing the world&acute;s largest sovereign wealth fund in Norway, for 13 years. Prior to that he led the fund&rsquo;s equity management organisation since its establishment in 1998. Earlier this month he joined Aker ASA, a Norwegian investment company, to oversee its newly created asset management division. The organization will be focused primarily on investments related to energy transition necessitated by climate change. Slyngstad holds degrees in economics, law, political sciences and philosophy from universities in Oslo and Paris, and the University of California. &nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;We very much look forward to Yngve Slyngstad joining the Supervisory Board,&rdquo; said Mayree Clark, Chair of the Supervisory Board&rsquo;s Nomination Committee. &ldquo;We will benefit from his network in the global financial industry and his vast experience as one of the pioneers of sustainable investing, as well as his current focus on cutting edge matters related to climate change and energy transition.&rdquo; &nbsp; <br /><br />Paul Achleitner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, added: &ldquo;We are delighted to be able to nominate Yngve Slyngstad, in line with our longstanding approach to bring together highly capable individuals in a diverse Supervisory Board which brings expertise and judgement for the benefit of the bank.&rdquo; &nbsp; <br /><br />&ldquo;I greatly appreciate the Supervisory Board&rsquo;s nomination,&rdquo; Slyngstad said. &ldquo;Deutsche Bank plays a crucial role in the development of Europe&rsquo;s financial industry and will play an important role in the financing of the transition to a sustainable and carbon-neutral economy. Subject to the vote at the AGM, I would be delighted to contribute to the further development of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s strategy.&rdquo; &nbsp; <br /><br /> Achleitner thanked Gerhard Eschelbeck, Chief Information Security Officer at Aurora Innovation, Inc., who joined Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Supervisory Board in 2017: &ldquo;Gerhard Eschelbeck has been a highly esteemed member of our Supervisory Board and made important contributions, in particular with his experience and expertise in technology.

Instead of walking miles to fetch clean water every day, people can use the time to make a living. The pumps we helped Swades supply were previously powered by electricity from the grid but supply is expensive and can be unreliable in remote parts of India.</p>\\n<p>For example, after cyclone Nisarga hit Maharashtra in June 2020, &nbsp;Chiklap village was without electricity for two months. The households in Chiklap also had to bear the monthly maintenance costs for electric pumps, amounting to a total of around 24,000 Indian rupees per year (around 280 euros at the current exchange rate).</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/03-mar/water day - village.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"water day - village\" /></p>\\n<p>Since switching to solar in December 2021, Chiklap&rsquo;s electricity costs have come down drastically and maintenance costs are down to a third of what they used to be. Nishant Katalkar, the Village Development Committee president of Chiklap, said, &ldquo;We are forever grateful to the Swades Foundation and Deutsche Bank. We can save more than 16,000 Indian rupees (about 190 euros) annually on the electricity bill. Swades Foundation&rsquo;s initiatives have always brought peace and happiness to our village.&rdquo; As part of this effort, 34 solar-powered water schemes have been installed in the district, impacting a total of 1,800 households.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/03-mar/water day - conservation.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"water day - conservation\" /></p>\\n<p>Through our long-standing partnership with the Swades Foundation, Deutsche Bank has also funded irrigation projects to help over 1,000 farmers access water&nbsp;for agriculture to increase their yield and annual income.

There were no meaningful divergences from the bank&rsquo;s unaudited results published at the Annual Media Conference on 27 January 2022.</p>\\n<p>In respect of events subsequent to December 31st 2021, the Annual Report describes Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s exposures to Russia and Ukraine and the potential risks resulting from Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. On March 9, the bank reported that Russia exposures are very limited and set out measures taken to mitigate these exposures. Additional details are available on the bank&rsquo;s website: <a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/RussiaExposure\">https://investor-relations.db.com/RussiaExposure</a></p>\\n<h3>Transformation on target with highest profit since 2011</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s 2021 Annual Report confirms progress towards the goals of the bank&rsquo;s transformation programme, launched in 2019. The benefits of transformation are evident in the bank&rsquo;s 2021 financial performance:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Profit before tax up more than threefold to &euro; 3.4 billion and net profit up fourfold to &euro; 2.5 billion</li>\\n<li>Post-tax return on tangible equity (RoTE)&sup1; up from 0.2% to 3.8%, with Core Bank RoTE1 up from 4.0% to 6.4%</li>\\n<li>Cost/income ratio improved to 85%, from 108% in 2019</li>\\n<li>Net revenues up 6% year on year to &euro; 25.4 billion</li>\\n<li>97% of total anticipated transformation-related effects already recognised</li>\\n<li>Proposed capital distribution to shareholders of approximately &euro; 700 million</li>\\n<li>Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 13.2%, in line with the bank&rsquo;s commitment of above 12.5%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>A clear strategic and financial roadmap through 2025</h3>\\n<p>At its Investor Deep Dive on 10 March, Deutsche Bank outlined its strategic and financial roadmap through 2025, building on the progress of its transformation programme. Deutsche Bank aims to build on its position as &lsquo;Global Hausbank&rsquo; by becoming the first point of contact in all financial matters for an even larger number of clients.</p>\\n<p>The bank aims to further strengthen cross-divisional collaboration through four leading core businesses, harness growth by driving its business strategies, and self-fund investments by enhancing efficiency.</p>\\n<p>If successful, this strategy would enable anticipated capital distribution to shareholders of around &euro; 8 billion in respect of the financial years from 2021-2025, subject to the requisite approvals.</p>\\n<p>The bank published clear<strong> financial objectives </strong>for 2025:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Post-tax RoTE&sup1; of greater than 10%</li>\\n<li>Compound annual revenue growth of 3.5% -4.5% from 2021, implying net revenues of approximately &euro; 30 billion in 2025</li>\\n<li>A cost-income ratio of below 62.5% with enhanced operating leverage through cost discipline enabling self-funded investments</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The bank also published details of its <strong>capital plan</strong> through 2025. This includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Maintaining a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 13%, subject to a minimum threshold of 200 basis points above the expected Maximum Distributable Amount threshold of approximately 11%</li>\\n<li>Tangible equity retention to support business growth and implementation of the first elements of the expected Basel III regulatory capital changes effective January 1, 2025</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Management Board announced its intention to reach a total payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to shareholders in 2025 and thereafter.</p>\\n<p>Further details of the bank&rsquo;s strategic and financial roadmap through 2025 are available on the bank&rsquo;s website: <a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/IDD2022\">https://investor-relations.db.com/IDD2022</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Compensation: discipline and reward for performance in 2021</h3>\\n<p><strong>Total compensation</strong> awarded to Deutsche Bank employees in respect of 2021 was &euro; 9.9 billion, down 2% from &euro; 10.1 billion in 2020. This development reflected lower severance and fewer retention payments compared to the prior year, together with workforce reductions and exchange rate effects.</p>\\n<p>Fixed compensation was &euro; 7.4 billion, down slightly from &euro; 7.5 billion in 2020. Variable compensation increased by 14% to &euro; 2.1 billion, mainly driven by the bank&rsquo;s improved financial performance.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Management Board</strong>, comprising ten members on a full-year equivalent basis, received total compensation for 2021 of &euro; 66.5 million, up from &euro; 50 million in 2020, reflecting performance against targets. This year on year development partly reflects a &euro; 4.6 million reduction in Management Board compensation in 2020, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included a reduction in the Group Component of variable compensation and an additional reduction in total compensation of one twelfth.</p>\\n<h3>Non-Financial report</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s 2021 Non-Financial Report, also published today, outlines the bank&rsquo;s role in the transition to a sustainable and climate-neutral economy; governance and operations; technology, data and innovation; and people and corporate social responsibility activities.</p>\\n<h3>2021: a pivotal year for sustainability at Deutsche Bank</h3>\\n<p><strong>Threefold rise in sustainable finance volumes:</strong> volumes in sustainable financing and investment ex-DWS, cumulative since the beginning of 2020, more than tripled in the year, reaching &euro; 157 billion by the end of 2021, up from &euro; 46 billion at the end of 2020, and significantly ahead of the bank&rsquo;s end-2021 target of &euro; 100 billion.</p>\\n<p><strong>Raised ambitions:</strong> Rapid growth enabled Deutsche Bank to accelerate its volume target of at least &euro; 200 billion. At its Sustainability Deep Dive in May 2021, the bank brought forward the date for achieving this target from end-2025 to end-2023. After announcing its full-year 2021 volumes in January 2022, Deutsche Bank again accelerated this target to end-2022. In its Investor Deep Dive of March 10, the bank announced an additional ambition of at least &euro;100 billion per year from 2023 to 2025.</p>\\n<p>Since January 2021, delivery on sustainable volume targets has been factored into the bank&rsquo;s top executive compensation framework.</p>\\n<p><strong>Supporting industry initiatives:</strong> Deutsche Bank underlined its commitment to work with partners from across the finance industry and beyond to combat climate change. In 2021, the bank joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), contributed to working groups of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and partnering with the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance to launch an Ocean Resilience Philanthropy Fund</p>\\n<p>As a founding member of NZBA, Deutsche Bank has pledged to align emissions in its loan portfolio to net zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement, and to help clients finance their transition to less carbon-intensive operations. This builds on the bank&rsquo;s commitments to no longer finance new oil &amp; gas drilling in the Arctic and oil sands projects in all jurisdictions, and to exit the financing of thermal coal mining by 2025.</p>\\n<p>On March 4, 2022, Deutsche Bank published data on financed greenhouse gas emissions in its corporate loan book and provided an update on net zero target setting in key industry sectors. <a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220304-deutsche-bank-provides-disclosure-on-financed-co2-emissions-and-updates-on-net-zero-target-setting?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank provides disclosure on financed CO2 emissions and updates on net zero target setting\">More details are available online</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Reducing the bank&rsquo;s own carbon footprint:</strong> Deutsche Bank further reduced the environmental impact of its own operations during 2021. Progress since 2019 included:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>63% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from own operations</li>\\n<li>20% reduction in total energy consumption</li>\\n<li>91% of electricity consumption from renewable sources, up from 75%</li>\\n<li>71% of all waste recycled, up from 61%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Rating agency upgrades:</strong> several ESG rating agencies have recognised the bank&rsquo;s progress. CDP has raised the bank&rsquo;s climate change score from C to B; S&amp;P Global raised its score for Deutsche Bank 60 out of 100 points in its S&amp;P Global CSA Assessment, up from 56 points in 2020, putting the bank back in the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index. Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Sustainalytics score improved from 30.0 (high risk) to 27.4 (medium risk).</p>\\n<h3>Continuing to reinforce the control environment</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank has implemented and continues to embed new processes and systems to reinforce and enhance its control environment and has invested around &euro; 3 billion in its control functions since 2019. Building on this momentum, the bank aims to continue to invest in controls during the next phase of its strategy. This includes expanding the risk framework in the evolving areas of non-financial risk, climate risk and cyber risk; continuing to develop preventative controls; and investing in enabling technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>\\n<h3>People and social responsibility</h3>\\n<p><strong>Supporting staff through the pandemic:</strong> Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s staff continued to face significant upheavals in their working environment and personal lives due to the COVID-19 in 2021. Up to 73,000 people have had to work remotely. Deutsche Bank took steps to support both the physical and mental wellbeing of staff, providing around 14,500 vaccinations to employees, relatives and external contractors.</p>\\n<p>The number of staff volunteering as Mental Health First Aiders grew to around 450 in 2021.</p>\\n<p><strong>Adapting to the future of work:</strong> in preparing for the post-COVID environment and in response to feedback from staff in the 2021 Future of Work employee survey, the bank is implementing a hybrid model which combines the advantages of remote and in-office work.</p>\\n<p><strong>Winning the commitment of staff:</strong> in the bank&rsquo;s 2021 People Survey, the commitment index reached 71%, up from 69% in 2020 and the best level since 2012. The enablement index, at 73%, was down slightly from 2020 but remained close to decade-long high levels.</p>\\n<p><strong>Investing in talent:</strong> Deutsche Bank continued to invest in talent during 2021, despite the constraints of COVID-19. The bank hired 1,420 graduates and vocational trainees, up from 1,287 in 2020, and invested some &euro; 38 million in employee training.</p>\\n<p><strong>Supporting diversity:</strong> with people from 156 different nationalities working in 58 countries worldwide, diversity is core to Deutsche Bank. The bank&rsquo;s commitment to <strong>gender diversity</strong> was reflected in several developments during 2021:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Women accounted for 20% of the Management Board, 30% of the Supervisory Board and 47% of all staff</li>\\n<li>47% of all Director Acceleration Program participants and 45% of Vice President Acceleration Program participants were women</li>\\n<li>The bank launched its &rsquo;35 by 25&rsquo; commitment, with the aim that at least 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President roles are held by women by 2025</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer and Intersex (LGBTQI) inclusion:</strong> Deutsche Bank is committed to an inclusive work environment and, in 2021, won two prestigious awards for its work in this area: the Human Rights Campaign Foundation&rsquo;s &lsquo;Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality&rsquo; and Yahoo Finance&rsquo;s &lsquo;OUTstanding LGBT+ Role Model Lists&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3>Continuing to support communities in challenging times</h3>\\n<p>COVID-19 did not prevent Deutsche Bank and its people from engaging with communities during 2021. Initiatives during the year included:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Launching the #NotAlone campaign which provided over &euro; 1 million for mental health projects, helping partner charities reach more than 123,000 children and young people</li>\\n<li>Donating &euro; 2 million for COVID-19 relief projects in India, including the provision of oxygen concentrators and hospital beds, with additional donations of nearly <br /> &euro; 200,000 from employees</li>\\n<li>Supporting employees teaching financial literacy in schools. Over 600 employees in Germany have registered; by end-2022 that number is expected to reach 700</li>\\n<li>Raising nearly &euro; 1 million to provide disaster relief to victims of flooding in Germany and Benelux countries from Deutsche Bank, the Deutsche Bank Foundation, and employees</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility:</strong> During 2021, Deutsche Bank and its foundations invested &euro; 52.1 million in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and art, culture and sport projects. These included Born to Be, the bank&rsquo;s youth engagement programme, and Made for Good, which supports social and creative ventures. More than 3.2 million people worldwide were reached by these programmes during 2021.</p>\\n<p><strong>Employee volunteering:</strong> 15,487 employees, or 18% of total staff, participated in the bank&rsquo;s volunteer programmes, up from 12,885 in 2020, donating over 133,000 hours of their time. Direct employee donations to charitable causes, and matching donations by the bank, raised &euro; 7.4 million for charitable causes during the year.<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<h3>Other financial and regulatory reports</h3>\\n<p>Today Deutsche Bank published its 2021 Pillar 3 Report and Annual Financial Statements of Deutsche Bank AG under German accounting rules (HGB).

We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values. We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight. And, as far as we can, we will continue to also support them, too, at this difficult time.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>There are, however, types of business we will cease.</p>\\n<p>First and foremost, it is our duty to support the German government and its international partners in their consistent stance and all their measures. At Deutsche Bank, we are fully committed to this. It must be up to all of us to defend democracy and freedom. This is the best thing the democratic world can do now to secure the stability of the global economy and long-term prosperity.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>At this stage, it pays off all the more that we have put our bank on a solid footing over the past four years. We are entering this difficult phase for the global economy in a very stable and resilient condition. In recent years, and especially during the Covid crisis, we have shown that we can deal with such an environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We are in a much better position today than we were in 2018. We have a robust balance sheet, a strong CET 1 capital ratio, ample liquidity, first-class risk management and improved controls. And we are sustainably profitable, so that we can also cushion possible setbacks, which so far have not become apparent. After our good performance in 2021, we have also made a strong start to the new year and are currently on track to achieve our targeted return on tangible equity of 8 percent this year.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Above all, however, we have found our balance again. After years of successful transformation, we know that our strategy is the right one. And we know exactly what our bank stands for and where we are headed.</p>\\n<p>We have a clear aspiration: to be the Global Hausbank for our clients. You may be familiar with the term; it was the title of the book we published two years ago to celebrate our bank&rsquo;s 150th anniversary. And, indeed, we have been working towards this goal in recent years. But we can become much better; in order to lend greater support to our clients and to grow as a bank. It is precisely this ambition that is at the heart of today\\'s Investor Deep Dive.&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>What is a Global Hausbank? Why is this mission so important to us?&nbsp;</h2>\\n<p>A Global Hausbank is a bank that is the first port of call for companies, institutional clients, retail and private clients and affluent individuals in all financial matters, with a global network and local expertise, with unique risk management and outstanding solution and product competence, as well as modern technology platforms.&nbsp;In short, a Global Hausbank is a reliable partner no matter what.</p>\\n<p>And probably at no point in time since the fall of the Berlin Wall has the need for such a partner been as great as now &ndash; in an environment rife with uncertainty and volatility.</p>\\n<p>Bill Gates said in 1994 that one day banking would still be necessary, but banks would not be. The situation today, though, is a different one: granted, the range of banking services is greater, the number of financial service providers higher than ever before. But banks are needed just as much as ever &ndash; to support companies, institutional and private clients navigate an increasingly complex world. Advisory, the classic banking business, is experiencing a renaissance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Our clients are not only facing the challenges that come with the current tensions; they also have to deal with macroeconomic shifts that have not been seen for decades. The phase of expansionary monetary and fiscal policy must end sooner or later. High debt and ageing societies are pushing states to their limits worldwide. At the same time, our clients have to deal with the transformation to a sustainable economy and keep pace with technological progress as it continues to accelerate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We want to be the bank that is part of the solution for our clients at this difficult time of complex challenges. And we believe that we are better equipped for this than virtually any other bank in Europe. We have the necessary expertise, product and solution competence and a vast network across the globe. Our clients appreciate that we are strong in the Americas and Asia. Together, the two regions account for more than 30 percent of our revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We are convinced that this opens up great potential for us to grow faster than the market in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>That is why, despite all the geopolitical uncertainties, we are going into our Investor Deep Dive with confidence today. This is not about an entirely new strategy; rather it is an evolution of what we have successfully done in recent years. We have built a strong foundation. And there are opportunities to be had from our set-up with four well-positioned businesses. Building on this, we would like to give you an idea of what we want to achieve in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We will focus on four goals:&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We are aiming for average annual revenue growth of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent, a growth rate similar to what we have achieved in the core bank in recent years. Achieving this would mean that we would reach a revenue level of around 30 billion euros annually in 2025.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>To get there, we will make targeted investments in our strengths &ndash; in technology and our controls, in our expertise and products, and in growth areas such as sustainability. We are funding this by further reducing complexity and reinvesting what we free up in our business. By the end of 2025, we are aiming for a cost-income ratio below 62.5 percent.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>We will invest primarily in those areas where we can achieve higher marginal returns. As a result, we expect a significant increase in our profitability. By the end of 2025, we aim to achieve a return on tangible equity of more than 10 percent &ndash; an important threshold as this would mean it is higher than our cost of equity for the first time in many years.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If we succeed in all this, we will be able to build up considerable amounts of capital over the next few years.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>On the one hand, and this is the fourth goal, we want to distribute a total of eight billion euros to our shareholders for the years 2021 to 2025 via dividends and share buybacks. On the other hand, we plan to wisely invest a significant portion of this sum in our business in order to enable further growth beyond 2025 &ndash; a time frame for which we already have a clear direction in mind for our bank: we aspire to be a European market leader that can play an active role in banking consolidation on our continent.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You can follow today&rsquo;s Investor Deep Dive live. <a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/IDD2022\" title=\"Register using this link\">Register using this link</a>. During the course of the year, we will invite our investors to further events at which we will then provide information on the strategic plans of the individual businesses and on our sustainability strategy.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Topics like this and the current environment raise many questions, which is why I am taking the time on Monday, March 14, from 1 to 2 pm CET for you to join me and ask your questions. You will receive a separate email with details of the invitation to this \"Ask me Anything\" session.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Although our Investor Deep Dive is taking place today in an environment different to what we would have hoped for, it is nevertheless one more milestone on our journey. It is the prelude to a new phase, a phase in which the focus will be on efficiency, investments and, in particular, on growth. We are determined to continue the successes of recent years and we believe we are best placed to do so.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>However, we will only be successful if each and every one of us makes a contribution to becoming even better. Together we can achieve a lot, as we have proven in recent years. All of us in the Management Board are very grateful to you for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Now it is important to press on with just as much determination and strength, fully focused on achieving the best for our clients, for our shareholders and for our bank as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Best wishes,&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Christian Sewing&nbsp;</p>', 'url': '/content.024a6e00-69d0-4032-8dfc-55c414c406f0', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Long Quach', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220310-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-idd', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'user-3ab970fe-bd69-440d-b725-1f093aa084fc', 'imageSmall': 'f021ca28-6c9a-489e-a8f2-32563e21245b'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-03-29 18:21:55.09', 'publishDate': '2022-03-10 12:30:00.0', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank raises its return on tangible equity target to above 10 percent', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '7336a019-eb22-4d84-8dc3-657e7e065148', 'archived': False, 'subHeadline': 'Strategy includes increased capital distributions and investments into growth', 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank raises its return on tangible equity target to above 10 percent', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4958', 'identifier': 'd44c6078-a8c7-4f18-9879-c9cbe45dfae6', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/strategy\" title=\"Deutsche Bank Strategy\">Deutsche Bank Strategy</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220310-deutsche-bank-raises-its-return-on-tangible-equity-target-to-above-10-percent', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220310-deutsche-bank-raises-its-return-on-tangible-equity-target-to-above-10-percent', 'richText': '<p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) announces an evolution of its strategy focused on delivering sustainable growth and higher returns at an Investor Deep Dive hosted today. By 2025, the bank aims to increase returns on average tangible equity (RoTE)&sup1; to above 10% and organically generate significant additional tangible equity.</p>\\n<p>This is expected to be achieved through a combination of revenue growth, further efficiencies and self-funded investments. Subject to successful implementation, this strategy would enable anticipated capital distributions to shareholders of around &euro; 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-2025 and substantial re-investment into Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s four leading businesses.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s financial targets for 2025 are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Post-tax RoTE&sup1; of greater than 10%</strong>, with disciplined resource allocation driving profitability;</li>\\n<li><strong>Compound annual revenue growth of 3.5-4.5%</strong> from 2021, with implied net revenues of approximately &euro; 30 billion in 2025;</li>\\n<li><strong>A cost/income ratio below 62.5%</strong>, reflecting revenue growth with further cost discipline, supported by ongoing efficiency initiatives enabling self-funded reinvestment.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Global Hausbank: a strong platform for sustainable growth</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s sustainable growth strategy builds on the fundamental transformation of the bank since 2019. The core of this strategy is to further expand Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s position as the \\'Global Hausbank&rsquo;. As the market leader in one of the world&rsquo;s strongest economies with a comprehensive suite of products, Deutsche Bank aims to become the first point of contact in all financial matters for an even larger number of clients and to further strengthen cross-divisional collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&rdquo;Over the past three years, we have built strong foundations for a resilient and sustainably profitable Deutsche Bank&rdquo;, Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer, said. &ldquo;Our strategy is now about shifting to sustainable growth and increased distributions to our shareholders. Our bank is well placed to help clients navigate through geopolitical and macroeconomic shifts, including the current uncertainties. And we are strongly positioned to help clients accelerate their transition to a more sustainable and digitized economy.&rdquo;</p>\\n<h3>Capital plan through 2025: supporting growth and returns to shareholders</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s capital plan is based on maintaining a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 13% in 2025, subject to a minimum threshold of 200 basis points above the expected Maximum Distributable Amount threshold of approximately 11%. The plan includes tangible equity retention to support business growth and implementation of the first elements of the expected Basel III regulatory capital changes effective January 1, 2025.</p>\\n<p>The Management Board announced its intention to reach a total payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to shareholders in 2025 and thereafter.</p>\\n<h3>Completing transformation: a positive start to 2022</h3>\\n<p>The current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment creates uncertainties whose impact cannot yet be fully assessed. Nevertheless, performance in January and February was ahead of the comparable period last year across key metrics as management continues to work toward delivery of its financial and transformation objectives for 2022.</p>\\n<p>Group highlights&sup2; for the year to date as of 28 February, including a two-month pro rata (two-twelfths) share of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s annual bank levy in both 2022 (plan) and 2021, include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity</strong> of 10.6%, versus 8.6% in the year to 28 February 2021</li>\\n<li><strong>Post-tax RoTE&sup1;</strong> of 11.8%, up from 9.7% in the year to 28 February 2021 and ahead of the 2022 target of 8%</li>\\n<li><strong>Core Bank post-tax RoTE&sup1;</strong> of 13.8%, up from 12.1% in the same period of 2021 and compared to a 2022 target of above 9%</li>\\n<li><strong>Cost/income ratio</strong> of 64.1%, down from 68.0% in the same period of 2021 and below the full-year 2022 goal of 70%</li>\\n<li><strong>CET 1 ratio</strong> of around 13.2%, well above the bank&rsquo;s 2022 goal of above 12.5%</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank aims to reach its 2022 goals through a combination of revenue growth, further reductions in adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1, and the substantial elimination of transformation-related effects&sup1;, 97% of which were recognised by the end of 2021.</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;For the full year 2022, we continue to expect to deliver a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8 percent&rdquo;, said <strong>James von Moltke</strong>, Chief Financial Officer. &ldquo;We have had a good start to the year across our businesses. While the war in Ukraine creates increased uncertainty in the market environment, our exposures to Russia are contained and well controlled.&rdquo;</p>\\n<h3>Building on progress of transformation since 2019</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s roadmap for 2025 is based on the progress of its transformation program launched in 2019. This included exiting non-strategic activities, refocusing the core businesses, reducing costs, investment in technology and controls and effective management of capital. Achievements to the end of 2021 have included:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Profit before tax of &euro; 3.4 billion, versus &euro; 1.3 billion in 2018</li>\\n<li>Business volume growth and share gains across core businesses, with revenues of &euro; 25.4 billion in 2021, up 6% year on year</li>\\n<li>Reductions of &euro; 3.6 billion in adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and reimbursable Prime Finance-related expenses&sup1; since 2018</li>\\n<li>Capital Release Unit leverage exposure down 86% and risk weighted assets down 61% since year end 2018, while reducing the cost burden from legacy assets by &euro; 2.2 billion</li>\\n<li>The self-financing of transformation, as organic capital generation and accretion from non-strategic asset reduction largely offset transformation-related costs and regulatory inflation</li>\\n<li>Strong growth in sustainable financing and investment, which reached &euro;&nbsp;157 billion by the end of 2021, and bringing forward the original 2025 target, of over &euro; 200 billion in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) financing and investment ex-DWS, to year end 2022</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank will host an <strong>Investor Deep Dive</strong> starting at 13:00 CET today. Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer, and James von Moltke, Chief Financial Officer, will present a review of the bank&rsquo;s current transformation programme and discuss Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s strategy and financial objectives through 2025.

The programme includes training in creative product design and live-streaming sales for around 80 local women who work in the traditional embroidery industry.</p>\\n<p>The impact is two-fold. The trainees will learn how to promote their well-designed products through e-commerce platforms, improving their income and quality of life, while also helping preserve and promote traditional crafts. Over 100 women benefitted from a similar entrepreneurship programme in 2021. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/Women-training-rural-China.JPG?language_id=1\" alt=\"Women-training-rural-China\" /></p>\\n<p>In India, the bank has been partnering with Self Employed Women\\'s Association (SEWA), to help women in rural communities become financially independent. This year, the bank is expanding support to over 400 women in poorer sections of society through four different programmes</p>\\n<p><strong>Gitanjali</strong> &ndash; Women from the waste-picking community are trained to make stationery items using wastepaper, and eventually become entrepreneurs by setting up their own stationery units. This gives them dignified employment as well as increases their monthly income.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUDI</strong> &shy;&ndash; This is an app-based agriculture cooperative run entirely by rural women producers. This app creates a rural retail network in all villages of the 14 districts of Gujarat, enabling direct market linkages to small farmers and supporting the distribution of quality essential nutritious food products. This leads to higher profit for the women.</p>\\n<p><strong>Kamala Caf&eacute; &amp; Kamala on Wheels </strong>is a chain of bakeries run by women in Gujarat. The programme provides livelihood training for women, including training on food processing and retail management. The women are also taught how to set up their own cafes on wheels or bakeries in their communities.</p>\\n<p>The <strong>Upcycling cooperative</strong> collects floral waste from offerings at temples and converts it into incense sticks. This project is expected to provide livelihood to over 20 women this year.</p>\\n<p><img src=\"/files/images/2022/05-may/women-training-rural-India.jpg?language_id=1\" alt=\"women-training-rural-India\" /></p>\\n<h2>Supporting women social entrepreneurs in the sustainability space</h2>\\n<p>From helping rural silk weavers in Thailand, addressing plastic pollution in Sabah, Malaysia to supporting local communities in the Philippines with sustainable fishing, 8 women social entrepreneur finalists pitched their solutions for tackling sustainability related problems in their local communities as part of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s regional BOOST-X programme in 2021. This programme was run in partnership with social-enterprise enabler Ashoka.</p>\\n<p>The BOOST programme equips APAC operations colleagues with new digital skills to drive efficiency and transformation at work. 11 BOOST participants mentored women social entrepreneurs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand who are working towards addressing climate change and sustainability in their communities.</p>\\n<p>Two entrepreneurs won 5,000 euros each from Deutsche Bank to help accelerate their sustainability projects. Fashion graduate and founder of Phinix Textile Recycling Centre, Pamela Mejia is tackling waste in the fashion industry by collecting and reusing textile waste and turning it into higher valued products that can be used again, such as shoes and bags.</p>\\n<p>Supaporn Tongsook, founder of the Foundation for Community Soul and Khwan Silk Craft, ensures Thai silk weavers are valued for their workmanship and not forced to sell their products at a lower prices due to economic inequality. Through her initiatives, including preservation of natural colored trees and upskilling, she hopes to have a concrete impact on their health and livelihoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;These programmes are just a few examples of what we have been doing to support women in the region, where the need is undeniable.

Using the standards established by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, an industry-wide initiative (PCAF Standards), Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions of the global corporate industry loan book were calculated at 30.8 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/y) as at year-end 2021.</p>\\n<p>The transparency provided today forms part of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s wider commitment to net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050, and to provide further disclosure on financed emissions of its loan portfolio and sector-specific decarbonization targets, by the end of 2022.</p>\\n<p>Within Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s corporate loan portfolio, financed emissions are concentrated in a few sectors and a very limited number of companies.</p>\\n<p>Three sectors account for around 68% of the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions: oil &amp; gas; utilities, including power generation; and steel, metals and mining. Total lending* to these sectors as at year-end 2021 was &euro; 17 billion, 16% of the bank&rsquo;s corporate industry loan book and around 3.5% of total loans. PCAF Standards and client data indicate that around 1% of corporate industry clients account for approximately 70% of the financed emissions in the bank&rsquo;s corporate industry loan book.</p>\\n<p>In 2021, financed emissions in these sectors were as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Oil &amp; gas: financed emissions of 9.7 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/y, or 32% of overall financed emissions in the corporate industry loan portfolio, on loan exposures of &euro; 8.2 billion</li>\\n<li>Utilities including power generation: financed emissions of 7.7 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/y, or 25% of the corporate industry loan portfolio total, with loan exposures of &euro; 4.5 billion;</li>\\n<li>Steel, metals &amp; mining: financed emissions of 3.5 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/y, 11% of the corporate industry loan portfolio&rsquo;s financed emissions, on loan exposures of &euro; 4.3 billion;</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The automotive sector accounts for a relatively modest portion of Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions, but forms part of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s net zero pathway analysis due to its contribution to Scope 3 emissions. The bank&rsquo;s approach and methodology by industry sector is set out in more detail in Towards Net Zero Emissions, a white paper published today.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;These disclosures are an important step on our pathway to net zero&rdquo;, said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank and Chairman of the Group Sustainability Committee. &ldquo;We are absolutely committed to building on this transparency and to supporting our clients in their transition and decarbonisation efforts. We are on track in embedding carbon intensity in Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s reporting, governance and risk management processes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3>Establishing sector-specific net zero targets</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank re-affirms its commitment to publishing 2050 net zero targets for key carbon intensive portfolios, together with intermediate targets for 2030, by the end of 2022. The bank also reaffirms its commitment, made within the Climate Commitment of the German Financial Sector (Klima-Selbstverpflichtung des deutschen Finanzsektors), to align its credit and investment portfolios to the goals of the Paris agreement, develop mutually accepted methodologies for measuring climate impact by the end of 2022, and report annually on progress.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>By using the International Energy Agency (IEA)&rsquo;s Net Zero scenario (NZE) as its benchmark, Deutsche Bank is developing net zero pathways for its overall loan portfolio, while concentrating on four particularly energy-intensive sectors driven by the following specific metrics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Oil &amp; gas: kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e per gigajoule (Gj) of production;</li>\\n<li>Power generation: kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e per megawatt hour;</li>\\n<li>Steel: kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e per tonne of steel produced;</li>\\n<li>Automotive: g of CO<sub>2</sub>/e per vehicle kilometre travelled (Scope 3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Additionally, the bank will expand its disclosures beyond its loan book into other on- and off-balance sheet activities such as capital markets financing and total committed facilities.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s fossil fuel policy prohibits the financing of new oil &amp; gas projects in the Arctic region or oil sands projects. Furthermore, the bank&rsquo;s coal policy prohibits the financing of new coal-fired power plants, and places under review the financing of energy companies which are more than 50% reliant on thermal coal to ensure they have credible diversification plans in place. The complete exit from the financing of thermal coal mining is planned by 2025.</p>\\n<h3>Working with clients on pathways to net zero</h3>\\n<p>Supporting clients as they define clear pathways towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change forms a core element of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s sustainability strategy.</p>\\n<p>To decarbonise its loan portfolio and other financing activities, Deutsche Bank will deploy different levers. These include providing transition financing to clients reducing their carbon footprint; rebalancing the bank&rsquo;s loan portfolio towards clients who are well advanced in developing de-carbonisation plans and focused on less carbon-intensive technologies, such as renewables.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank is also committed to addressing industry-wide climate-related data challenges by refining data quality through several levers: reducing reliance on proxy data; improving data quality from third party providers, and incorporating more data sourced directly from individual clients.</p>\\n<h3>Working with industry partners</h3>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank is actively involved in industry-wide initiatives on climate and other ESG risks, accounting and reporting standards and industry frameworks. These include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Contributing, as a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), to NZBA working groups whose purpose is to develop consistent international standards to propel the implementation of decarbonization strategies</li>\\n<li>Participating, as a member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), in PCAF&rsquo;s Sovereign and Capital Market Instruments Working Groups as well as its Climate Data Working Group;</li>\\n<li>Participating in the Science Based Targets initiative&rsquo;s (SBTi) Expert Advisory Group (EAG).

The ECB&rsquo;s decision requires Deutsche Bank, on a consolidated basis, to maintain an unchanged Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) of 2.50% of which at least 1.41% must be covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital, and 1.875% by Tier 1 capital. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The ECB&rsquo;s decision requires Deutsche Bank, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio of at least 10.43%.

This sets the stage for making green investment and financing the most important market theme in the coming decades, says Deutsche Bank Research China Strategist Linan Liu. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>A greener 2021</strong></p>\\n<p>High-quality green development was a key theme in the country&rsquo;s Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) last year. In 2021, real GDP growth in China was 8.1 percent year on year and it was notably greener compared with 2020, said Liu.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;First, energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) fell by 2.7 percent year on year; second, clean energy consumption (natural gas, hydro/nuclear/wind/solar power) accounted for 25.3 percent of total energy consumption, up by one percentage point from 2020; and third, output of new energy cars and solar powered batteries rose by 145.6 percent and 42.1 percent year on year,&rdquo; Liu explained.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Asia Research team expects China&rsquo;s energy intensity to continue decreasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Accelerating green in 2022</strong>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>China&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;1+N&rdquo; &nbsp;policy framework that aims to facilitate its peaking and neutrality goal is set to continue in 2022. &ldquo;We see more policies connecting to 1+N, &nbsp;with clear targets and effective measures, including specific green transition plans for energy, industry, transportation, agriculture and urban and rural construction,&rdquo; says Liu.</p>\\n<p>Liu&nbsp;expects fiscal stimulus spending to focus on green infrastructure investment in 2022, mostly in new areas such as clean energy, digitalisation, the data centre industry and 5G wireless networks.</p>\\n<p>Industry experts estimate China's average annual green financing demand to be between 2.5 and 16 trillion renminbi before 2060. As green investment accelerates in 2022, so will the structure and breadth of China's green finance market, Liu says.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Which green sectors will China invest in?&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n<p>According to Liu, clean energy comes out on top. This includes solar and wind power, as well as other renewable sources, including but not limited to hydro, nuclear power and hydrogen energy.</p>\\n<p>To make travel greener, China&nbsp;needs to build more charging stations for electrical vehicles and more inter-city and commuter rail lines. There is also immense potential to apply carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology to China's carbon-intensive industries, says Liu.&nbsp;</p>\", 'url': '/content.d45800b3-fa0e-4f64-83ff-163fd1783411', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Harikumar Rajasekhar', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220128-a-greener-future-for-china', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'imageSmall': '7c35b5b4-6bde-494b-9c53-1ff58f607cb0'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-03-29 18:50:46.56', 'publishDate': '2022-01-27 20:30:00.0', 'title': 'Results 2021: Annual Media Conference Highlights', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '48099a43-4b57-4eb4-b3f3-cfd1015c0942', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '3', 'working': True, 'movingImagePreview': 'AJb1XPRzERnT7L6b4hAkms', 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Results 2021: Annual Media Conference Highlights', 'live': True, 'movingImageVideo1': 'AJb1XPRzERnT7L6b4hAkms', 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4958', 'identifier': '1cbaa1f9-3e10-4953-97e2-401bebbdb40c', 'urlTitle': '20220127-full-year-results-2021-and-annual-media-conference', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220127-full-year-results-2021-and-annual-media-conference', 'richText': '<p>On 27 January 2022, Deutsche Bank reported its results for the fiscal year 2021: highest full-year net profit since 2011, profit before tax was &euro; 3.4 billion.

All four core businesses performed at or ahead of our plan, and our reduction of legacy assets progressed faster than expected. We are delighted to be resuming capital distributions to our shareholders as we promised in the summer of 2019. Our transformation progress and financial performance in 2021 provide a strong step-off point to achieve our target of a return on tangible equity of 8% in 2022.<span class=\"author\">Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer</span></blockquote>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today reported its highest full-year net profit since 2011. Profit before tax was &euro;&nbsp;3.4 billion in 2021, up by more than three times year on year, also the best for ten years.&nbsp;Net profit was &euro;&nbsp;2.5 billion, a more than fourfold increase over 2020.</p>\\n<p>Full-year 2021 results included transformation-related effects&sup1;of &euro;&nbsp;1.5 billion, up 21% versus 2020, as Deutsche Bank continued to execute its transformation programme.</p>\\n<p>Adjusted profit before tax1, which excludes transformation-related effects&sup1;and specific revenue items, more than doubled versus 2020 to &euro;&nbsp;4.8 billion. Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity was 3.4%, up from 0.2% in 2020. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders&rsquo; equity (RoTE)&sup1;was 3.8%, versus 0.2% in the prior year. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, profit before tax was &euro;&nbsp;82 million and net profit was &euro;&nbsp;315 million, up 67% year on year. The fourth quarter tax benefit reflected a positive deferred tax asset valuation adjustment of &euro;&nbsp;274 million resulting from the strong performance of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s US operations.</p>\\n<p>Net revenues in the quarter were &euro;&nbsp;5.9 billion, up 8% year on year, while noninterest expenses rose 11% year on year. This increase partly reflected a 17% year on year rise in transformation-related effects&sup1;to &euro;&nbsp;456 million. Adjusted profit before tax&sup1;, which excludes these effects, was &euro;&nbsp;527 million, down 15% year on year.</p>\\n<p>On January 26, 2022, Deutsche Bank announced actions which would provide total capital distributions to shareholders of approximately &euro;&nbsp;700 million. This represents the first step towards the bank&rsquo;s previously announced commitment to return &euro;&nbsp;5 billion of capital to shareholders over time. The Management Board has decided to initiate a share repurchase programme of &euro;&nbsp;300 million, to be completed in the first half of 2022, and intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting a cash dividend of &euro;&nbsp;0.20 per share for the financial year 2021. &nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Core Bank: profit before tax up 48% to &euro;&nbsp;4.8 billion in 2021</h2>\\n<p>In the Core Bank, which excludes the Capital Release Unit, profit before tax was &euro;&nbsp;4.8 billion, up 48% year on year, while adjusted profit before tax&sup1;rose 46% to &euro;&nbsp;6.1 billion. Post-tax RoTE was 6.4%, up from 4.0% in the prior year, while adjusted post-tax RoTE&sup1; was 8.5%, up from 5.7%. The Core Bank&rsquo;s cost/income ratio was 79%, unchanged from 2020.</p>\\n<p>All core businesses contributed to year on year growth in profit before tax in 2021, as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank: up 86% to &euro;&nbsp;1.0 billion;</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank: up 17% to &euro;&nbsp;3.7 billion;</li>\\n<li>Private Bank: up by &euro;&nbsp;465 million to &euro;&nbsp;366 million;</li>\\n<li>Asset Management: up 50% to &euro;&nbsp;816 million.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, Core Bank profit before tax was &euro;&nbsp;434 million, down 27% year on year. Revenue growth of 7% was offset by growth of 12% in noninterest expenses which partly reflected a 31% year on year rise in transformation-related effects&sup1;to &euro;&nbsp;435 million. Adjusted profit before tax1, which excludes these effects, was &euro;&nbsp;860 million in the quarter, down 13% year on year.</p>\\n<h2>Capital Release Unit: continued portfolio reduction, bottom line improvement and completion of Prime Finance transfer</h2>\\n<p>The Capital Release Unit delivered another year of significant portfolio reduction while further reducing the cost of de-leveraging in 2021. The transfer of clients, technology and key staff from Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Global Prime Finance and Electronic Equities businesses to BNP Paribas was successfully completed by the end of 2021, meeting the targeted timeline.</p>\\n<p>At year-end, risk weighted assets (RWAs) were reduced to &euro;&nbsp;28 billion, down from &euro;&nbsp;34 billion at the end of 2020 and ahead of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s end-2022 target of &euro;&nbsp;32 billion. As at year end, the Unit&rsquo;s RWAs included Operational Risk RWAs of &euro;&nbsp;20 billion. Leverage exposure was &euro;&nbsp;39 billion at the end of 2021, down 46% from &euro;&nbsp;72 billion at the end of 2020.</p>\\n<p>Since its inception in mid-2019, the Capital Release Unit has reduced RWAs by 57%, or &euro;&nbsp;37 billion, and leverage exposure by 84%, or &euro;&nbsp;210 billion.</p>\\n<p>The Capital Release Unit reported a substantial improvement in P&amp;L in 2021. The loss before tax was &euro;&nbsp;1.4 billion, down 38% from a loss before tax of &euro;&nbsp;2.2 billion in 2020. This improvement was primarily driven by a 26% reduction in noninterest expenses, reflecting a 35% reduction in adjusted costs ex-transformation charges&sup1;during the year.</p>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, the Capital Release Unit reported a loss before tax of &euro;&nbsp;352 million, a 15% loss reduction compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>\\n<h2>Revenues: fourth quarter growth includes record revenues in Asset Management</h2>\\n<p>Net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;25.4 billion in 2021, up 6% versus 2020. Revenue growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net revenues up 8% year on year to &euro;&nbsp;5.9 billion. Within Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s core businesses, revenue development in 2021 was as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;5.2 billion, flat versus 2020. The Corporate Bank grew business volumes, with &euro;&nbsp;8 billion in loan growth and &euro;&nbsp;18 billion in deposit growth during 2021. Accounts with deposits of &euro;&nbsp;101 billion were covered by deposit repricing agreements by year-end, which contributed revenues of &euro;&nbsp;364 million in 2021. These factors successfully offset interest rate headwinds. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;1.4 billion, up 10% year on year, the highest revenues of any quarter since the formation of the Corporate Bank in 2019, as an easing of interest rate headwinds and business volume growth positively impacted revenues. Both Corporate Treasury Services and Institutional Client Services achieved revenue growth of 12%, while Business Banking revenues declined 1%, reflecting ongoing interest rate headwinds.</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank net revenues rose 4% to &euro;&nbsp;9.6 billion in 2021. Revenues in Fixed Income &amp; Currencies (FIC) Sales &amp; trading were essentially flat year on year, while revenues in Origination &amp; Advisory rose 23%. Deutsche Bank regained the No. 1 position in Origination &amp; Advisory in Germany for the year 2021 with a share of 9.2% (source: Dealogic). In the fourth quarter, Investment Bank net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;1.9 billion, up 1% year on year. A 14% decline in FIC revenues versus a strong prior year quarter was offset by 29% growth in Origination &amp; Advisory revenues, the eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth.</li>\\n<li>Private Bank net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;8.2 billion in 2021, up 1% year on year, or up 2% if adjusted for forgone revenues resulting from the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on customer consent for pricing changes on current accounts and the non-recurrence of a negative prior year impact from the sale of Postbank Systems AG. The Private Bank generated business volume growth of &euro;&nbsp;45 billion in 2021, 50% ahead of its target threshold, including &euro;&nbsp;23 billion in net inflows into investment products and &euro;&nbsp;15 billion in net new client loans. Volume growth more than offset the adverse revenue impact of interest rate headwinds. Business volumes in 2021 included environmental, social and governance (ESG) assets under management of &euro;&nbsp;26 billion and growth in ESG client loans of &euro;&nbsp;4 billion. In the fourth quarter, Private Bank net revenues were &euro;&nbsp;2.0 billion, up 4%. Revenues in Private Bank Germany were up 8%, or down 2% if adjusted for the prior year impact of Postbank Systems and the BGH ruling. Revenues in the International Private Bank were down 2%, or up 6% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of prior year revenues relating to Sal. Oppenheim workout activities.</li>\\n<li>Asset Management net revenues grew 21% to &euro;&nbsp;2.7 billion in 2021, reflecting growth in both management fees and performance fees. Assets under management grew to a record &euro;&nbsp;928 billion at the end of 2021, up &euro;&nbsp;135 billion or 17% during the year. This was partly driven by record 12-month net inflows of &euro;&nbsp;48 billion, with inflows across Active, Passive and Alternative assets. Full year inflows in ESG assets were &euro;&nbsp;19 billion, or around 40% of total net inflows. In the fourth quarter, Asset Management net revenues were a record &euro;&nbsp;789 million, up 32% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Assets under management grew by &euro;&nbsp;45 billion in the quarter, including net inflows of &euro;&nbsp;15 billion, the seventh consecutive quarter of net inflows, including &euro;&nbsp;6 billion of ESG assets.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Expenses: 97% of total transformation-related effects already recognised</h2>\\n<p>Noninterest expenses were &euro;&nbsp;21.5 billion in 2021, up 1% year on year. These included transformation-related effects&sup1;of &euro;&nbsp;1.5 billion, up 21% year on year, predominantly driven by transformation charges of &euro;&nbsp;1.0 billion, up from &euro;&nbsp;490 million in 2020. By the end of 2021, 97% of total transformation-related effects&sup1;anticipated through the end of 2022 were already recognised. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges&sup1;and reimbursable expenses related to Prime Finance were down 1% year on year to &euro;&nbsp;19.3 billion, a reduction of 10% since 2019.</p>\\n<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s workforce was reduced to 82,969 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at the end of 2021, down by 1,690 FTEs since the end of 2020, despite continued internalisation of external contract staff and selective hiring to support business growth. This compares to 90,866 FTEs at the launch of the transformation programme in July 2019.</p>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, noninterest expenses rose by 11% to &euro;&nbsp;5.6 billion. These include transformation-related effects of &euro;&nbsp;456 million, up 17% year on year, primarily reflecting a 46% rise in restructuring and severance expenses. Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and reimbursable expenses related to Prime Finance&sup1;rose 6% to &euro;&nbsp;4.9 billion, or 4% if adjusted for exchange rate movements. This development was driven by higher compensation expenses which primarily reflected improved business performance, and technology costs reflecting the execution of the bank&rsquo;s technology and platform strategies.</p>\\n<h2>Credit provisions: significant reduction versus 2020</h2>\\n<p>Provision for credit losses was &euro;&nbsp;515 million in 2021, down 71% versus 2020, reflecting a supportive credit environment, high quality loan book and continued strict risk discipline against a backdrop of economic recovery due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions during 2021. Provision for credit losses was 12 basis points of average loans, down from 41 basis points in 2020.</p>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses was &euro;&nbsp;254 million, essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. A lower net release for performing (Stage 1 and 2) loans of &euro;&nbsp;5 million, down from a net release of &euro;&nbsp;101 million in the prior year quarter, was offset by a 26% year on year reduction in provision for non-performing (Stage 3) loans to &euro;&nbsp;259 million.</p>\\n<h2>Conservative capital and balance sheet management throughout 2021</h2>\\n<p>The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 13.2% at the end of 2021, compared to 13.6% at the end of 2020. RWAs increased from &euro;&nbsp;329 billion to &euro;&nbsp;352 billion during the year. The full-year CET1 ratio development reflects a net negative impact of approximately 90 basis points from regulatory and methodology changes during 2021, partly offset by reductions in Market Risk and Operational Risk RWAs and organic capital growth through retained earnings.</p>\\n<p>These enabled Deutsche Bank to support both increased lending to clients and future distributions to shareholders, while maintaining its commitment to a CET1 ratio above 12.5%.</p>\\n<p>In the fourth quarter, the CET1 capital ratio, at 13.2%, was 22 basis points higher than in the third quarter. The ratio benefited from an increase in CET1 capital, reflecting the positive impact of a regulatory-driven reversal of capital deductions. RWA remained essentially flat during the quarter, as growth in Credit Risk RWAs, reflecting business growth in the Core Bank, was largely offset by reductions in Market Risk and Operational Risk RWAs.</p>\\n<p>The Leverage ratio was 5.0% in the fourth quarter on a phase-in basis and 4.9% on a fully loaded basis, compared to a phase-in leverage ratio of 4.9% and 4.8% fully loaded at the end of the third quarter. This improvement primarily reflected the issuance of &euro;&nbsp;1.25 billion of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital during the quarter.</p>\\n<p>These ratios exclude certain central bank balances under applicable rules. Including these balances, the fully loaded Leverage ratio would have been 4.5% in the quarter, and 4.6% on a phase-in basis, in line with the bank&rsquo;s 2022 financial target of around 4.5% fully loaded.</p>\\n<p>Liquidity reserves were &euro;&nbsp;241 billion at year-end, versus &euro;&nbsp;249 billion at the end of the third quarter, including High Quality Liquid Assets of &euro;&nbsp;207 billion. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 133%, well above the regulatory requirement of 100% and a surplus of &euro;&nbsp;52 billion. The Net Stable Funding Ratio was 120% at year-end, at the top of the bank&rsquo;s target range of 115-120%, with a surplus of &euro;&nbsp;101 billion above required levels.</p>\\n<h2>Sustainable Finance: record quarterly volume accelerates progress</h2>\\n<p>By the end of 2021, cumulative environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related financing and investment volumes reached &euro;&nbsp;157 billion ex-DWS since the beginning of 2020. This significantly exceeds Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s target of at least &euro;&nbsp;100 billion by year-end 2021 and is on track to exceed the bank&rsquo;s target of at least &euro;&nbsp;200 billion by year-end 2023.</p>\\n<p>ESG-related financing and investment volumes were a record &euro;&nbsp;32 billion ex-DWS in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 2021 total to &euro;&nbsp;112 billion. In the fourth quarter, Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s businesses contributed as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Corporate Bank: &euro;&nbsp;8 billion in sustainable financing in the quarter, raising the business&rsquo; cumulative total since the beginning of 2020 to &euro;&nbsp;26 billion;</li>\\n<li>Investment Bank: &euro;&nbsp;14 billion in fourth quarter sustainable financing and capital market issuance, for a cumulative total of &euro;&nbsp;87 billion. In 2021, Deutsche Bank ranked 5th globally in ESG-related debt and sustainability-linked bond issuance as measured by fees, up from 8th in the full year 2020 and 13th in 2019 (Source: Dealogic);</li>\\n<li>Private Bank: &euro;&nbsp;9 billion growth in ESG assets under management and a further &euro;1 billion in new client lending, raising the Private Bank&rsquo;s cumulative total to &euro;&nbsp;44 billion.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>During the fourth quarter, Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s progress in sustainable banking was recognised by ratings upgrades from several independent agencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The UK-based non-profit organisation CDP raised Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s rating to B, reflecting a more active approach and taking co-ordinated action on climate issues;</li>\\n<li>S&amp;P raised Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s rating in its annual Global Corporate Sustainability assessment, enabling the bank to return to the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index;</li>\\n<li>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Sustainalytics score improved, reducing the risk rating from &lsquo;high&rsquo; to &lsquo;medium&rsquo;.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Read the <a href=\"/files/documents/2022/01-JAN/Deutsche-Bank-reports-2021-profit-before-tax-of-EUR-three-dot-four-billion.pdf\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports 2021 profit before tax of &euro;&nbsp;3.4 billion\">full media release in the downloadable PDF</a>.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption\">Cumulative ESG volumes include sustainable financing (flow) and investments (stock) in the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Private Bank from January 1, 2020, to date, as set forth in Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Sustainability Deep Dive of May 20, 2021.

Non-GAAP financial measures are measures of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that contain adjustments that exclude or include amounts that are included or excluded, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in our finan&shy;cial statements.</p>\\n<h4>Examples of our non-GAAP financial measures, and the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures, are as follows:</h4>\\n<table width=\"965\" height=\"575\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th>\\n<p>Non-GAAP Financial Measure</p>\\n</th><th>\\n<p>Most Directly Comparable IFRS Financial Measure</p>\\n</th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Adjusted Profit (loss) before tax, Profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders, Profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after AT1 coupon&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>&nbsp;Profit (loss) before tax</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Revenues excluding specific items, Revenues on a currency-adjusted basis, Revenues adjusted for forgone revenues due to the BGH ruling</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>&nbsp;Net revenues</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Adjusted costs, Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges, Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and expenses eligible for reimbursement related to Prime Finance</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Noninterest expenses</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Net assets (adjusted)</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Total assets</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Tangible shareholders&rsquo; equity, Average tangible shareholders&rsquo; equity, Tangible book value, Average tangible book value</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Total shareholders&rsquo; equity (book value)</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity (based on profit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders after AT1 coupon), adjusted post-tax return on equity measures</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders&rsquo; equity</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Post-tax return on average shareholders&rsquo; equity</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<p>Tangible book value per basic share outstanding, Book value per basic share outstanding</p>\\n</td>\\n<td>\\n<p>Book value per share outstanding</p>\\n</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Adjusted profit (loss) before tax is calculated by adjusting the profit (loss) before tax under IFRS for specific revenue items, transformation charges, impairments of goodwill and other intangibles, as well as restructuring and severance expenses.</li>\\n<li>Specific revenue items generally fall outside the usual nature or scope of the business and are likely to distort an accurate assessment of the divisional operating performance.</li>\\n<li>Revenues on a currency-adjusted basis are calculated by translating prior period revenues that were generated in non-euro currencies into euros at the foreign exchange rates that prevailed during the current period. These adjusted figures, and period-to-period percentage changes based thereon, are intended to provide information on the development of underlying business volumes.</li>\\n<li>Adjusted costs are calculated by deducting (i) impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, (ii) net litigation charges and (iii) restructuring and severance (in total referred to as nonoperating costs) from noninterest expenses under IFRS.</li>\\n<li>Transformation charges are costs included in adjusted costs that are directly related to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s transformation as a result of the new strategy announced on July 7, 2019, and certain costs related to incremental or accelerated decisions driven by the changes in our expected operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such charges include the transformation-related impairment of software and real estate, the accelerated software amortisation and other transformation charges like onerous contract provisions or legal and consulting fees related to the strategy execution.</li>\\n<li>Transformation-related effects are financial impacts resulting from the strategy announced on July 7, 2019. These include transformation charges, goodwill impairments in the second quarter 2019, as well as restructuring and severance expenses from the third quarter 2019 onwards. In addition to the aforementioned pre-tax items, transformation-related effects on a post-tax basis include pro-forma tax effects on the aforementioned items and deferred tax asset valuation adjustments in connection with the transformation of the Group.</li>\\n<li>Expenses eligible for reimbursement related to Prime Finance: BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank signed a master transaction agreement to provide continuity of service to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Prime Finance and Electronic Equities clients. Under the agreement Deutsche Bank operated the platform until clients could be migrated to BNP Paribas by the end of 2021. Expenses of the transferred business were eligible for reimbursement by BNP Paribas.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For descriptions of non-GAAP financial measures and the adjustments made to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures to obtain them, please refer to pages 17-25 of the financial data supplement which is available at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/quarterly-results\" title=\"Quarterly Results\">www.db.com/quarterly-results</a></p>'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-03-29 18:01:43.813', 'publishDate': '2022-01-27 05:00:00.0', 'title': 'A message from Christian Sewing on our full-year results 2021', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '0e215e0e-87a6-4699-919a-28b4e2461be8', 'archived': False, 'subHeadline': 'The following message from CEO Christian Sewing was sent to all staff of Deutsche Bank', 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'A message from Christian Sewing on our full-year results 2021', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3032', 'identifier': '9ff8991f-8849-4ca3-9ba9-41781aeab75b', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220127-full-year-results-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports 2021 profit before tax of &euro; 3.4 billion\">Deutsche Bank reports 2021 profit before tax of &euro; 3.4 billion</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20220127-annual-media-conference-2022?language_id=1\" title=\"Annual Media Conference 2022\">Annual Media Conference 2022</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20211027-deutsche-bank-reports-profit-before-tax-of-EUR-554-million-in-the-third-quarter-of-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports profit before tax of &euro; 554 million in the third quarter of 2021\">Deutsche Bank reports profit before tax of &euro; 554 million in the third quarter of 2021</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210728-deutsche-bank-reports-profit-before-tax-of-EUR-1-2-billion-in-the-second-quarter-of-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports profit before tax of &euro; 1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021\">Deutsche Bank reports profit before tax of &euro; 1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210428-bank-reports-EUR-1-6-billion-profit-before-tax-in-the-first-quarter-of-2021?language_id=1\" title=\"Deutsche Bank reports &euro; 1.6 billion profit before tax in the first quarter of 2021\">Deutsche Bank reports &euro; 1.6 billion profit before tax in the first quarter of 2021</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/strategy\" title=\"Strategy\">Strategy</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/ir\" title=\"Investor Relations\">Investor Relations</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220127-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-our-full-year-results-2021', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220127-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-our-full-year-results-2021', 'richText': '<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>\\n<p>In July 2019, when we published our transformation strategy and our goals for 2022, our plans were met with scepticism. Few observers were confident that we would be able to achieve such ambitious objectives within three and a half years.</p>\\n<p>They were just as doubtful that we would successfully realign our business model or that we would manage to significantly reduce costs, to make Deutsche Bank sustainably profitable once again. Hardly anyone believed that we would finance the transformation from our own resources and be able to return capital to our shareholders, as we promised.</p>\\n<p>Today we are proving that we keep our promises. At the beginning of the third and final year of our \"Compete to Win\" strategy, we are once again presenting a set of results we can all be proud of.</p>\\n<p>Our profit before tax for 2021 was 3.4 billion euros and we reported net profit of 2.5 billion euros. Not only is this last figure more than four times the amount we reported in 2020, it is also the highest we have reported since 2011. This will allow us to resume distributing a significant amount of capital to our shareholders.</p>\\n<p>Yesterday, we announced our plans to propose at our AGM in May to distribute around 400 million euros in the form of dividends. Additionally, the Management Board decided to repurchase shares worth 300 million euros. This is an important milestone and is the result of all your hard work for our stakeholders and for our bank.</p>\\n<p>On behalf of the entire Management Board, thank you!</p>\\n<p>Our excellent full-year results for 2021 are all the more remarkable when you bear in mind how heavily we invested last year to accelerate our transformation. Almost all of the anticipated costs related to our bank&rsquo;s transformation have now been recognised: 97 percent to be precise. And we achieved all of this in what has been a persistently tough economic environment.</p>\\n<p>In 2021, Covid prevented us from working in the way we would have liked in many areas. I have a great deal of respect for how you dealt with all the constraints and setbacks in what was the second year of the pandemic and kept reacting in a flexible way to an environment that was rapidly changing, often completely unexpectedly.</p>\\n<p>Our profit is particularly pleasing because all our businesses contributed to its growth. In 2021, we increased profit and revenues across the four pillars of the Core Bank and proved the worth of our balanced business model.</p>\\n<p>Full-year net revenues for the group were 25.4 billion euros. That is an increase of 6 percent over 2020. And we owe this increase largely to strong growth in new business and gains in market share. Revenue development in 2021 in our core businesses was as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/cb\" title=\"Corporate Bank\">Corporate Bank</a> grew business volumes, with 8 billion euros in loan growth in 2021 and 18 billion euros in deposit growth during the year. At the same time, we charged fees on a greater proportion of our deposits, bringing us a total of 364 million euros in revenues in 2021. These repricing arrangements and business growth offset interest rate headwinds, enabling us to grow profit before tax by 86 percent, while revenues were stable. The final quarter was particularly good as negative interest rate effects declined significantly, lifting revenues by 10 percent year-on-year.</li>\\n<li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/i-b\" title=\"Investment Bank\">Investment Bank</a> succeeded in increasing its revenues by 4 percent compared to an already strong previous year. Profit before tax was also up by 17 percent. We owe this positive development not only to a resilient performance by our trading and financing businesses, but also to a revenue increase of 23 percent in Origination &amp; Advisory. In 2021, we regained our Number 1 position in Germany in this area. And in the fast-growing ESG debt business, we ranked fifth globally, after coming in at 13th place two years ago (Source: Dealogic).</li>\\n<li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/pb\" title=\"Private Bank\">Private Bank</a> returned to profitability in 2021 and grew its revenues by 1 percent year on year. This meant it was able to offset both the effects of the negative interest rate environment and the adverse impact of the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruling on current account fees. The main growth driver here was new business volumes. We booked net inflows of 23 billion euros into investment products and granted net new client loans worth 15 billion euros. Deposits in the Private Bank grew by 7 billion euros.</li>\\n<li>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/dws\" title=\"Asset Management\">Asset Management</a> business had a very successful year. After net inflows of 48 billion euros and good performance on investments, it now has 928 billion euros of assets under management &shy;&ndash; both record levels. Consequently, net revenues rose by 21 percent to 2.7 billion euros in 2021. Profit before tax increased by 50 percent to 816 million euros. We are particularly pleased that 40 percent of total net inflows were invested in DWS funds with a focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) aspects.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This heightened interest in ESG is not only being seen in Asset Management; enthusiasm for ESG products is growing rapidly in all our businesses. By the end of the year, ESG-related financing and investments reached 157 billion euros. We will therefore most probably achieve our target of at least 200 billion euros as early as 2022 instead of at the end of 2023.</p>\\n<p>The fact that we defined Sustainability as a top management priority in the summer of 2019 has paid off. We have not only expanded our Sustainability team but have also hired additional ESG experts in the regions and in our businesses. And that is just the beginning.</p>\\n<p>Our achievements in the field of sustainability also show that our transformation is about more than just numbers. It concerns bringing about profound change; it is about defining our bank&rsquo;s purpose. We are the Global Hausbank and as such we want to be the best possible adviser, partner and risk manager for our clients.</p>\\n<p>To achieve this, we have been making targeted investments in our business and we have also set aside additional money for variable compensation.</p>\\n<p>In doing so, we are responding to recent wage developments in some highly competitive areas of the banking sector, where the race to attract the best and most talented people is now much tougher. We have also increased technology spending and accelerated our transformation, because that will enable us to permanently reduce costs and support business growth. And we have continued to invest to optimise our anti-money laundering systems and to further strengthen our controls.</p>\\n<p>These investments are the main reason our adjusted costs fell more slowly in 2021 than in previous years. At 19.3 billion euros, adjusted costs ex-transformation charges and reimbursable Prime Finance expenses were about 250 million euros lower than a year earlier.</p>\\n<p>We remain fully disciplined on costs and aim to continue to reduce our spending as planned to achieve our 8 percent return on tangible equity target as well as our cost/income ratio target of 70 percent this year.</p>\\n<p>With our Capital Release Unit performing ahead of its year-end 2022 plan, we have already created the necessary conditions for both these targets to be met. At the end of last year, we also successfully completed the transfer of clients, technology and personnel from our Prime Finance business and electronic brokerage to BNP Paribas.</p>\\n<p>The fact that we will be able to distribute capital again this year is down to our solid balance sheet. Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at the end of 2021 was higher than we had planned, despite the negative impact of regulatory methodology changes.</p>\\n<p>At 13.2 percent it remains well above our minimum target and regulatory requirements.</p>\\n<p>With this strong capital base and our excellent market position relative to our global competitors, it is now in our hands to successfully complete our three-and-a-half-year transformation strategy. This requires that we once again work hard and stay absolutely focused on our goals.</p>\\n<p>This year we can finally prove to the market that we are sustainably profitable. There is incredible potential &ndash; not least for our share price. We are still at around 45 percent of book value, which would not do justice to a bank that earns a return on tangible equity of 8 percent. Let\\'s prove together that we can do it. The year has started well; now we must build on this &ndash; day after day, week after week, month after month, quarter after quarter.</p>\\n<p>So far, we have shown what our bank is made of &ndash; and what all of you, our colleagues all over the world, are made of. We have put Deutsche Bank back on a path towards sustainable profitability and growth. And we are determined that nothing will throw us off course. Now let&rsquo;s convince those who still doubt us.</p>\\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\\n<p>Christian Sewing</p>', 'url': '/content.2972291f-3555-4c6f-acdd-bb3e7ad831e7', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Tilo Braun', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220127-a-message-from-christian-sewing-on-our-full-year-results-2021', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.4139', 'imageSmall': 'f484a65a-3afc-491d-ac89-ce107618bc0e'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-03-29 18:21:14.083', 'publishDate': '2022-01-27 05:00:00.0', 'title': 'Against exclusion and forgetting – We show the light', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': '5c98dfcf-8919-419c-94ab-3e1e0ce54879', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Against exclusion and forgetting – We show the light', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3032', 'identifier': 'deecd5cc-fdd4-4f76-89ed-c0a0bd38638f', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210126-memorial-service-for-the-victims-of-the-holocaust-five-against-forgetting?language_id=1\" title=\"Memorial service for the victims of the Holocaust\">Holocaust Remembrance Day 2021</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bvb.de/eng/News/Overview/Borussia-Dortmund-supports-the-Yad-Vashem-Memorial\" title=\"Borussia Dortmund supports the Yad Vashem Memorial\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\">Borussia Dortmund supports the Yad Vashem Memorial</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.daimler.com/company/news/statement-against-anti-semitism-and-racism.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"Daimler confirms again its commitment against antisemitism and racism\">Daimler confirms again its commitment against antisemitism and racism</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://strrudel.com/77-years-of-the-liberation-of-auschwitz-the-light-of-remembrance-must-never-go-out\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"77 years of the liberation of Auschwitz: &ldquo;The light of memory must never go out&rdquo; (strrudel.com)\">77 years of the liberation of Auschwitz: The light of memory must never go out</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"Yad Vashem &ndash; The World Holocaust Remembrance Center\">Yad Vashem &ndash; The World Holocaust Remembrance Center</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.banking-history.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Historical Association of Deutsche Bank\">Historical Association of Deutsche Bank</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/diversity\" title=\"Diversity &amp; Inclusion\">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220127-against-exclusion-and-forgetting-we-show-the-light', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220127-against-exclusion-and-forgetting-we-show-the-light', 'richText': '<p>Since 2019, Deutsche Bank, together with football club Borussia Dortmund, Daimler, Deutsche Bahn and Volkswagen, has been supporting the expansion of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel.\\u202fFor this year\\'s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/remembrance-day/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"Holocaust Martyrs\\' and Heroes\\' Remembrance Day\">Holocaust Memorial Day</a> on 27 January, the Bank is participating in a \"Show the Light\" sticker campaign by the Friends of Yad Vashem in Germany:&nbsp;80,000 stickers depicting a Hanukkah menorah were distributed to all readers of the daily newspaper \"<a href=\"https://www.kn-online.de/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"Kieler Nachrichten (in German)\">Kieler Nachrichten</a>\" this week and are intended to set an example against exclusion, violence and forgetting.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/artifacts/museum/prewar-hanukkah-menorah-kiel.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-disclaimer\" title=\"Hanukkah Menorah from the Home of Rabbi Akiva &amp; Rachel Posner in Kiel, Germany\"><img src=\"/files/images/2022/01-jan/Hanukkah-menorah--Rahel-Posner-Kiel-1931.png?language_id=1\" alt=\"Hanukkah Menorah from the Home of Rabbi Akiva &amp; Rachel Posner in Kiel, Germany\" width=\"500\" height=\"525\" class=\"float-right\" /></a>Rahel Posner photographed the hanukkiah&nbsp;shown here to mark Hanukkah in 1931.

Corporates will face investor demands to communicate clear transition strategies; invest in smart infrastructure to prepare for energy-as-a-service business models; demonstrate emission reduction in the medium-long term.</li>\\n<li>The impact of ESG regulations on investments and financing: rapid growth in ESG investments is creating differing regulatory regimes, fragmenting ESG investor expectations for corporates with a cross-border investor base. Regulations standardising the definition of green in Europe could result in differentiation for &ldquo;dark green&rdquo; debt that is demonstrably aligned with a net-zero by 2050 objective.</li>\\n<li>The growth of ESG in private markets: as more investors turn to alternate strategies, ESG is becoming mainstream in private markets at all stages. ESG is relevant for assessing a company&rsquo;s return profile, scaling decarbonization technology and demonstrating exit preparedness in mature companies.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Read the full report:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.db.com/files/documents/2022/01-JAN/ESG-Capital-Markets-2022-Outlook.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Deutsche Bank ranked top five arranger of ESG debt in 2021\">ESG 2022 Outlook</a></p>', 'url': '/content.2d68f6d5-0219-4528-8799-2e4949b1496a', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Tilo Braun', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20220113-headline-deutsche-bank-ranked-top-five-arranger-of-esg-debt-in-2021', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.4139', 'imageSmall': '74408fc6-88e2-483d-acda-1734b8eb3666'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-01-14 02:58:00.933', 'publishDate': '2022-01-13 09:30:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'harikumar.rajasekhar@db.com', 'title': 'Best High Yield Bond House in Asia', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'ea313134-f938-4c08-9c8c-3d7cd9629b2e', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Best High Yield Bond House in Asia', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.2951', 'identifier': 'e2818ac6-ad9b-42f5-9f28-97c1eb78927c', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://country.db.com/asia-pacific/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Deutsche Bank in Asia Pacific\">Deutsche Bank in Asia Pacific</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20220113-best-high-yield-bond-house-in-asia', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20220113-best-high-yield-bond-house-in-asia', 'richText': '<p>Global Capital has named Deutsche Bank as the Best High Yield Bond House in Asia in 2021, underscoring the bank&rsquo;s consistent track record and execution capabilities in debt capital markets across the region</p>\\n<p>&ldquo;In a particularly challenging year for high yield, Deutsche showed its prowess by offering clients timely and relevant advice and positioning them correctly to capture market windows,&rdquo; said GlobalCapital.

This transaction represents an important step forward in the development of ESG-linked financing with robust targets related to &ldquo;S&rdquo; or social considerations.</p>\\n<p>The short-term loan facility establishes clear metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) with respect to ESG considerations, as well as concrete targets for those metrics that Home Credit has committed to achieve over the term of the loan. The primary KPIs focus on expanding credit access to underserved communities in the Philippines, including female and first-time borrowers, and increased provision of financial literacy programs in the Philippines.</p>\\n<p>The transaction also features targets around Home Credit&rsquo;s digitalization efforts, committing them to providing at least 60% of their loans via digital channels, in order to provide a higher level of transparency to customers, to enable more equitable loan rates and terms to customers regardless of their economic or social background. In addition, the KPIs track data to confirm Home Credit&rsquo;s commitment to protect the data privacy of its customers, and ensure that data is only used by Home Credit for agreed purposes.</p>\\n<p>These KPIs will be measured and verified by an independent third party advisor. The loan complies with the Sustainability-linked Loan Principles of the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association.</p>\\n<p>Jean Lafontaine, Group Head of Funding, Treasury, M&amp;A and Investor Relations at Home Credit, &ldquo;As a business, we are consistently looking at innovative funding solutions and this is our first ever ESG-linked loan at Group level and an important milestone. ESG is not something new to Home Credit Group and is part of our company DNA. We are delighted that our continued efforts to deliver greater financial inclusion in markets like the Philippines &ndash; our other markets more broadly &ndash; are being recognized. With the KPIs linked to this loan facility, we are even better placed to continue to deliver equitable and transparent access to financial services for the communities where we operate. This transaction reflects the trust that our partners have in our work to drive our ESG agenda.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>Kamran Khan, Deutsche Bank Head of ESG for Asia Pacific said, &ldquo;This is a pioneering transaction reflecting the transitioning of consumer lending in Asia towards responsible and sustainable lending. It also evolves the ESG landscape by demonstrating that beyond environmental considerations, financing can also be meaningfully tied to social impact objectives, which in this case are strongly focused on financial inclusion. The parameters of the loan track and incentivize Home Credit&rsquo;s commitment to provide loans to new market entrants, which are typically women and young adults obtaining credit for the first time. This is an emerging and important area of ESG, particularly in Asia; both the need and the opportunity to drive impact are great.&rdquo;</p>', 'url': '/content.2d2fbb8d-2364-4588-a868-0584e46c2802', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Tilo Braun', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20211222-home-credit-philippines-and-deutsche-bank-sign-groundbreaking-esg-loan', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.4139', 'imageSmall': '2e3196f6-58a0-4f23-b4a3-bcaeac48db00'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-04-11 19:31:33.577', 'redirectUrl': 'https://www.db.com/what-next/entrepreneurial-success/Dossier-Bold-Moves/tomatoes-made-in-italy-still-a-promising-business-idea?language_id=1&kid=wn.stageGHP.mutti.en', 'publishDate': '2021-12-21 18:30:00.0', 'imageLarge': 'cfac9841-d25b-4d60-aafb-bb7c3f7077fe', 'title': 'A bold move towards quality', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'e5a87de2-2d34-4880-a1de-29ea37a24082', 'archived': False, 'subHeadline': 'What Next / Entrepreneurial Success', 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'A bold move towards quality', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3029', 'identifier': 'eb784870-023f-4e41-bcdc-a578a54e513b', 'urlTitle': '20211221-a-bold-move-towards-quality', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20211221-a-bold-move-towards-quality', 'linkWordingForStage': 'Watch our video about Mutti Tomatoes', 'url': '/content.94c0baff-f626-41f7-b69b-8bb829007678', 'titleImage': 'imageSmall', 'modUserName': 'Jacques Regnier', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20211221-a-bold-move-towards-quality', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': True, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.3032', 'imageSmall': '47ebf069-c1c4-4ea7-b9e0-9b05df99dc5d'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-07-14 12:52:11.007', 'publishDate': '2021-12-20 12:00:00.0', 'title': 'Inigo Martos appointed Regional Chief Executive Officer Iberia and Chief Country Officer Spain', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'c00e54a0-a9fa-4b9d-923c-38cacca96c7f', 'archived': False, 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Inigo Martos appointed Regional Chief Executive Officer Iberia and Chief Country Officer Spain', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.4763', 'identifier': 'c4bd748b-f981-4707-81a5-f2de2c2e77ef', 'usefulLinks': '<p><a href=\"https://deutschewealth.com/\" title=\"Wealth Management Business\">Wealth Management Business</a></p>', 'urlTitle': '20211220-inigo-martos-appointed-regional-chief-executive-officer-iberia-and-chief-country-officer-spain', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20211220-inigo-martos-appointed-regional-chief-executive-officer-iberia-and-chief-country-officer-spain', 'richText': \"<p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) today announced the appointment of <strong>Inigo Martos</strong> as Regional Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Iberia, Chief Country Officer (CCO) Spain, CEO of Deutsche Bank S.A.E.

After years at the International Monetary Fund and the German Council of Economic Experts, his economic expertise was certainly beyond question. And as economic adviser to the German Chancellor, he undoubtedly knew how to solve the most difficult situations, be it in the financial crisis of 2008 or the Opel rescue.</p>\\n<p>But would that be enough in an environment where experienced central bankers like Axel Weber or J&uuml;rgen Stark resigned after fundamental debates on monetary policy?</p>\\n<p>Would his always calm voice for a stability-oriented central bank policy be heard? Would he be able to exert influence on a clear majority that also wanted to make full use of the central bank\\'s resources in the sovereign debt crisis? Or would he find a seat far down the table with 17 other central bank presidents under ECB President Mario Draghi, who was soon to announce that they would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro? &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>There is no simple answer to these questions, even today. The role of the German representative on the Governing Council of the European Central Bank is probably one of the most difficult economic policy tasks that the government assigns. That person represents a long tradition with a clear stance. This is a stance, however, that other central bankers do not always share. Political reality has led to a new monetary policy reality that was not foreseen in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. The Greek crisis, national debt, a global pandemic &ndash; the challenges were and are enormous.</p>\\n<p>In such an environment, it takes strong diplomatic skills to defend one\\'s position with force and effect. And it takes stamina. Jens Weidmann has all that, as he has proven time and again. Even if the media in half of Europe sometimes portrayed him as a block to progress, even if criticism sometimes came from politicians in Berlin, and even if the then ECB President accused him of saying \"no to everything\" &ndash; Jens Weidmann remained steadfast without getting carried away.</p>\\n<p>The Bundesbank President always presented his arguments factually, he remained polite but firm. Delicate in argument, but tough on matter. When he says something or gives advice, it is precise, well thought out and encourages you to reflect. That is how I always experienced Jens Weidmann in personal conversations. He embodied something like a monetary conscience of the Bundesbank in Europe for the last decade.</p>\\n<p>A conscience whose admonitions seem more justified than ever, especially now, as he prepares to stand down.</p>\\n<p>There were many tests for Weidmann. A major one came in late summer 2012, when he opposed the ECB\\'s emergency programme, which was designed to allow the large-scale purchase of government bonds from crisis countries. He stood his ground even when pressure was put on him from all sides and he was the only one in the then 23-member ECB Governing Council to vote against the programme. Even the German government defended the ECB decision which the Bundesbank President had opposed.</p>\\n<p>Weidmann continued to fight, not with a broadsword, but with a foil. It says a lot about his style that one of his most famous speeches is less political than literary. At an event shortly after the controversial decision, he did not speak about Greece, Italy or current monetary policy. He spoke about Goethe\\'s \"Faust II\", about how Mephisto persuaded the emperor to print money. How at first everything looked shiny and comfortable &ndash; but soon after ended in rapid inflation. The message was sent.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>That his critics accused him of an attitude of refusal does not do justice to the upright Bundesbank President. Weidmann did not say \"no to everything\". Rather, he persistently said \"yes\" to monetary policy principles, \"yes\" to a narrow interpretation of the rules in the Maastricht Treaty. Weidmann is not fundamentally opposed to a loose monetary policy &ndash; he proved this once again at the end of his term in office when he explicitly supported the ECB\\'s quick action in the coronavirus crisis.</p>\\n<p>He was influenced by the experience of the 2008 financial crisis, when the determination of central banks and governments also prevented a catastrophe. And he also supported the new monetary policy strategy adopted by the ECB this year. What distinguishes him from many other central bankers is not a particular preference for higher interest rates &ndash; but that he considers the central bank\\'s mandate neither malleable nor negotiable, even in times of crisis.</p>\\n<p>He is a strict advocate of the primacy of monetary stability that has so characterised the Bundesbank in its history.</p>\\n<p>First and foremost, the central bank has the mandate to keep money stable. He sits in the tradition of Otmar Issing, the first chief economist of the European Central Bank. If there is to be a redistribution between states motivated by fiscal policy, then the politicians must agree it &ndash; and they must not pass this problem on to the central bank. While all members of the ECB Governing Council would agree with this principle, then as now, it is on the question of where exactly the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy lies that Weidmann was stricter than most.</p>\\n<p>Sceptics accuse him of achieving little in the end with this adherence to principle, because he neither prevented the ECB\\'s crisis programmes nor stopped the ultra-loose monetary policy. There is no denying that in the end he could not convince a majority on the ECB Governing Council of his position. But it would be too short-sighted to judge him on that alone.</p>\\n<p>For the ECB, his role can perhaps be compared to that of an opposition in parliament: The criticism of the parliamentary minority forces the majority to better justify its policy &ndash; and to refrain from extreme steps because it would then provide the opposition with a target.</p>\\n<p>We should therefore be grateful to Jens Weidmann for often being the spokesman for this opposition and for sometimes accepting the bogeyman role. This included not only voting against controversial decisions in ECB Governing Council meetings, but also publicly representing his point of view. That may not always be welcome in a central bank tradition that likes to demonstrate consensus to the outside world. However, given the considerable influence the European Central Bank has on the economy and thus on the lives of around 340 million people in the Eurozone, it is a public debate that the ECB must surely face up to.</p>\\n<p>At the same time, Weidmann never left any doubt that a common policy in a monetary union must always juggle different requirements &ndash; and he actively worked on such solutions. \"While Jens had clear views on monetary policy,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde said on his departure, &ldquo;I was always impressed by his search for common ground in the Governing Council, by his empathy for his Eurosystem colleagues, and his willingness to find a compromise.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>This also says a lot about Weidmann\\'s style.</p>\\n<p>He has secured the legacy of an institution that has enjoyed the highest reputation in Germany for decades. The Bundesbank can no longer set the course alone in a monetary union with 19 members. But at least it can continue to act as an anchor for a stability-oriented monetary policy &ndash; without ever calling the euro itself into question. Jens Weidmann has shaped this role over the past 10 years. It was and remains important for Germans\\' confidence in the euro.</p>\\n<p>The past months have shown that the ultra-loose monetary policy is coming to an end and that consumer prices are also rising again. And that Weidmann was right with his key warning: that it would become difficult for the ECB to change course when rising inflation made it necessary.</p>\\n<p>That is also because debtors in Europe &ndash; many of them, governments &ndash; are de facto dependent on permanently low interest rates. These are the ghosts we have summoned, to paraphrase Weidmann in the words of Goethe. Weidmann himself will no longer participate in the decisions that are now pending. He has decided for himself that 10 years at the helm of the Bundesbank is enough.</p>\\n<p>Jens Weidmann and I have always agreed that we can only secure prosperity and competitiveness in the EU if we work closely together. More Europe must be the goal &ndash; even if we sometimes must struggle to find the right way to get there.</p>', 'url': '/content.e45181ec-8352-4c17-9021-188bcf8c4524', 'titleImage': 'TITLE_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND', 'modUserName': 'Tilo Braun', 'urlMap': '/news/detail/20211217-a-man-of-principle-christian-sewing-on-the-outgoing-bundesbank-president-jens-weidmann', 'folder': 'SYSTEM_FOLDER', 'hasTitleImage': False, 'sortOrder': 0, 'modUser': 'dotcms.org.4139', 'excerpt': 'Christian Sewing wrote this piece for Handelsblatt after they chose Jens Weidmann, the outgoing President of the Bundesbank, as one of their ‘People of the Year’.'}, {'hostName': 'www.db.com', 'modDate': '2022-03-29 20:34:47.777', 'publishDate': '2021-12-13 10:45:00.0', 'contactPerson': 'Frank.Hartmann@db.com', 'title': 'Deutsche Bank helps Berlin start-up make the leap to the USA', 'baseType': 'CONTENT', 'inode': 'f48c1fcc-b06f-47e0-8200-7d10c3fbae66', 'archived': False, 'subHeadline': 'Everphone wants to expand with mobile phone and tablet rentals', 'host': '8e29bc28-e0f6-40f1-930a-6258631a0985', 'layoutType': '1', 'working': True, 'locked': False, 'stInode': '71b4a34b-8593-4167-9135-06f2f0b39687', 'contentType': 'C03news', 'headline': 'Deutsche Bank helps Berlin start-up make the leap to the USA', 'live': True, 'owner': 'dotcms.org.3218', 'identifier': 'd37180b9-3c99-496e-860e-3df3045816dd', 'urlTitle': '20211213-deutsche-bank-helps-berlin-start-up-make-the-leap-to-the-usa', 'languageId': 1, 'URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT': '/news/detail/20211213-deutsche-bank-helps-berlin-start-up-make-the-leap-to-the-usa', 'richText': '<p>Why buy smartphones and tablets when companies can rent them cheaply?
